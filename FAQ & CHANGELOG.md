## FAQ

*Why?*

I haven't a straightforward answer. It started as something I wanted and couldn't find elsewhere. Later I started to see it as way of using my research/procrastination positively.

*Can I help?*

Not sure yet. Anyway, for transparency, the source is available on Github and I'm open to pull requests.

---

*Will you publish it as a paperback and as a proper ebook?*

Yes. As soon as I arrive to a stable draft (and I'm still far from it), I'll publish it more formally.

*What's the milestone for this project?*

This book will never be complete. I'll be polishing it during my lifetime and on relevant occasions I will release a new version.
