### FAQ:

*Will you publish it as a paperback and as a proper ebook?*

Yes. As soon as I arrive to a stable draft (v1.0), I'll publish it more formally.

*What's the milestone?*

This book will never be finished. I'll be updating it during my lifetime and on relevant occasions I will release a new version.
