## FAQ

#### Why?

It started as something I wanted to read and couldn't find elsewhere. Later I started to see it as a way of using my research/procrastination positively.

#### What are your main biases?

Western culture (European flavour), loose minimalism, centrism, agnosticism and I'm male.

---

#### Can I help?

I'm always open to criticism, suggestions and grammar corrections (I'm not a native english speaker).

---

#### Will you publish it as a paperback and as a proper ebook?

Yes. As soon as I arrive to a stable draft (and I'm still far from it), I'll publish it more formally. On relevant occasions I might even release a new version.

#### What's the milestone for this project?

This project will never be complete. I plan to polish it during my lifetime.

I actively research it since 2014 but formally (on a Github repository) it started in 2016. At the time of writing, Wisdom TLDR Guide has 5 chapters and 84 sections. Spending 10 minutes per month researching or updating each section seems underwhelming, still it accrues - easily - to two workdays.
