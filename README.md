###TL;DR 

###3 rules for life: fuck, don't give a fuck and don't be fucked over.

---
###On identity

You are your deeds. Have personal accountability. Know yourself. Invest in yourself.

You have to invest in yourself before you will ever see success in business. You have to master skill sets, understand your personality and constantly educate yourself if you ever wish to be successful.
