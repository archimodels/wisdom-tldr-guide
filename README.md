<a id="on-happiness"></a>Break or mix some long term goals with shorter term ones so you can enjoy the journey.<br>
Happiness is a journey, not a destination.

> *'The minute you’re satisfied with where you are, you aren’t there anymore.' -- Tony Gwynn*

<!-- 
> *'We have the idea that comfort brings happiness. Happiness comes from not having fear.'*

If I’m happy with low expectations, I’m going to be pretty happy in general,
happiness equals reality over expectations, how negative criticism that bothered you as an insecure teenager will probably bother you now

what he did wrong along the way, and how keeping expectations to a minimum has maximized his happiness.

Tell Your Truth No Matter What

Life is About Who You Become Not What You Achieve
On this journey called life, many people lose sight of what is really important.
They believe that material wealth, sexual experiences, and physical prowess are what makes a man.
But the reality is, life is about the man that you become, not the things that you do or the possessions that you gather.
It’s about your character.
It’s about who you impact, the way you show up in the world, and the way that you treat those around you.

integrity is what you think is what you say, and the same what you do.
being vulnerable is taking don't be afraid of taking a risk.

Generosity without Expectation is Sexy
It means that your thoughts, words, and actions are all in congruence.
you don’t live a life that is incongruent with what you want to make others happy.
You live a life of congruence where everything is in line.
This is the pathway to true power.

1 - i approve of me.
2 - i am my word.
5 - i keep my word / i take nothing she says seriously, helps me relax.

Part of being a man is being a protector.protector of everyone who comes into your life.
Part of Being a Man is Getting Shit Done
As an occasional treat, video games or TV are not inherently bad, but we live in a society where most men waste 3+ hours a day in a virtual world when they should be getting shit done.

Background values will change how you think
-->

> *'The greatness of a man is not in how much wealth he acquires, but in his integrity.' -- Bob Marley*

> *'So much depends on reputation – guard it with your life.' -- Robert Greene (5th law of power)*

> *'It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it. If you think about that, you’ll do things differently.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'Seek respect, not attention. It lasts longer.'*

Aim at being your best self. You need to come alive.

> *'Waking up to who you are requires letting go of who you imagine yourself to be.' -- Alan Watts*

> *'If you try to be something you're not, you end up being nothing.'*

> *'Don’t ask yourself what the world needs, ask yourself what makes you come alive and go do that. Because what the world needs is more people to come alive.' -- Howard Thurman*

> *'If you are feeling lost in life, you need to experience more things. Do whatever you have to do to give yourself more experiences and grow into the man that you want to become.'*

> *'The definition of a man is and should be an evolving target. Never stop working on yourself. Always strive to be better.'*

<!--
Live in accordance with your nature. If something is forced it will not be sustainable.
Focus more on what you’re naturally good at. If something is holding you back, recognize it and fix it, but you don’t have to be great at everything. You need to be good enough at the right thing, one time.
You weren’t made to spend 10 hours a day staring at a screen in a cubicle arguing over email. If you do this your body will fall apart. As your body falls apart so will your brain. As your brain goes so does your chances of success or happiness.

<a id="on-humbleness"></a>HOWEVER, remember to be humble, you are not perfect neither you'll ever be.

> *'A way to humble yourself is to put you in the position of being the weakest person in something during the day.'*

> *'Everyone you will ever meet knows something you don't.' -- Bill Nye*



===
###On freedom

Aim at being independent.

> *'Freedom is more precious than any gifts for which you may be tempted to give it up.'*

> *'My independence is my legacy.' -- Bagão Felix*

> *'A man is free at the instant he wants to be.' -- Voltaire*

> *'There comes a time when you ought to start doing what you want. Take a job that you love. You will jump out of bed in the morning. I think you are out of your mind if you keep taking jobs that you don't like because you think it will look good on your resume.' -- Warren Buffett*

Do not truly commit to anything but *yourself*.

> *'Do not commit to anyone.' -- Robert Greene (20th law of power)*

> *'That’s the problem with putting others first: you’ve taught them you come second.'*

> *'Choose a life you want and then create the things you need around it. A girl, a job, a friend, all of those should help you achieve the life you want. If it doesn’t, get rid of it.'*

> *'You have only so much energy and so much time. Every moment wasted on the affairs of others subtracts from your strength.'*

> *'To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.' -- Ralph Waldo Emerson*



###On generosity

Be generous from a place of abundance, where you are giving because you are already so full, not from a place of scarcity where you are kind because you want something in return.

HOWEVER, «givers» attract «takers». Don't let them drain you, you're [free](#on-freedom) and you don't owe them anything.

> *'Dás uma mão, arrancam-te o braço.'*



===
###On ambition and motivation

Succeeding at mediocrity isn't a worthwhile life.

> *'Winning isn’t everything, but wanting to win is.' -- Vince Lombardi*

> *'It’s hard to beat a person who never gives up.' -- Babe Ruth*

> *'The greatest risk to a man is not that he aims too high and misses, but that he aims too low and hits.'*

> *'Work hard in silence. Let your silence be your noise.'*

> *'How much time do you consume vs produce? Are you watching others do things you could be doing if you weren’t watching them.' -- Allen Tucker*

HOWEVER, don't be thirsty: the [journey](#on-happiness) will not be enjoyable and people will [envy](#on-outliers) you.

<!--
on settling:
If You Are Not Growing You Are Dying
Life is about constant and never-ending growth.
If you want to live your life in such a way that you can take your final breath with a smile on your face, then you must be willing to commit yourself to constant growth.F!ck complacency.
I don’t care if you have $10,000,000 in the bank account, a model wife, and all the material possessions this world has to offer, if you are not pushing yourself to grow and expand, you are digging yourself an early grave.
Never settle in life, never be content with who you are and what you have achieved.
You have to constantly push yourself to do more, achieve more, and, most importantly become more.

Most 16 year olds are just using their phones to send silly snaps to their friends and watch porn.
And most people waste their lives away in 9-5 jobs. It's not an age thing.

“We must suffer one of two pains, either the pain of discipline or the pain of regret and disappointment.”

lying in death bed and regretting your life is the worst that can happen to you.

> *'I miss being the age when i thought I would have my shit together by the time I was the age i am now.'*

play to win, not hoping to make it, or why are you doing it? committed to win

###On success

There is no shortcut to the top. Success is a castle that you build [brick by brick](#on-habits).<br>
Success is not being [wealthy](#on-wealth) but being [fulfilled](#on-gratefulness-and-happiness).

> *'Success is peace of mind which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you did your best to become the best you are capable of becoming.' -- John Woode*

> *'Success is simple, but it is not easy. Success is nothing but the accumulation of small things done consistently over a long period of time.'*

> *'Success doesn’t come to you. You go to it.' -- Marva Collins*

HOWEVER, [doubt](#on-confidence-and-validation), not failure, is the biggest barrier to success.

> *'The greatest barrier to success is the fear of failure.' -- Sven Goran Eriksson*

> *'Doubt kills more dreams than failure ever will.'*



===
###On comfort and risk

You need to break rules to achieve anything great.<br>
Breaking rules [frightens](#on-fear-and-excuses) people but comfort is the enemy of achievement.

> *'There is pleasure in the pathless woods.' -- Lord Byron*

> *'A ship is safe in the harbor but that's not what ships are for.'*

> *'Think of yourself as an explorer. You cannot find anything new if you are unwilling to leave the shore.'*

> *'You can choose courage or you can choose comfort, but you can't choose both.'*

> *'Take risk. Big audacious risk. You’ll never get what you want in life without it.'*

<!--
Choose the Hard Way. Life is easy, and a soft life makes for soft people. Take a cold shower, join a boxing gym, use the stairs instead of the escalator, go out in nature alone for a week.
-->



===
###On habits

Consistency is key. Consistency doesn’t come from effort, it comes from systems.
Habits allow [mastery](#on-mastery) and [success](#on-success).

> *'We are what we repeatedly do, excellence therefore is not an act, but an habit.' -- Aristotle*

> *'52 approaches in a year is more than most men make in a lifetime. Consistency is everything.'*

> *'Volume usually outpaces intensity. You can’t just put in a huge effort a few times. You must do things over and over, usually the hard way.' -- Allen Tucker*

Create high value systems: [meditate](#on-meditation), spend time outside, [rest](#on-health), travel, learn useful skills.<br>
Avoid low value systems: social media, news, owning a TV, working long hours, control of petty stuff.

> *'Go for a walk in the morning and decide what would make the day a successful day.' -- Allen Tucker'*

> *'Use social media as an output not as entertainment. Your phone should not be the first thing you see in the morning nor the last thing you see at night.
Spend the last hour of the day (or all day) without electronic devices.' -- Allen Tucker'*

> *'Don’t concern yourself with the news. It makes other people’s stories more interesting when you don’t know what’s going on outside your world. The news causes completely unnecessary stress and it’s negatively biased.' -- Allen Tucker*

<!--
good decisions compound.

mental checklist of positive habits.

People who are driven by the fear of missing out or the dream of early adopter super stardom are deploying a “middlebrow inference” that examines only the maximum possible return, not the value derived in expectation.
The opportunity cost of missing a ‘new new thing’ like the airplane and the automobile is minuscule compared to the toxicity of all the garbage one has to go through to get these jewels.”
t’s the rejection of such thinking that has led me to continue to abstain from Facebook and Twitter, among other popular pastimes in the rapidly evolving digital attention casino.

Use your phone to set reminders for really important things automatically. Turn off push notifications for everything else.
-->



===
###On improvement

Most problems can be solved by graded exposure over time.<br>
You improve by [practice](#on-learning-by-practice) and [theory](#on-learning-by-theory).

> *'To improve is to change; to be perfect is to change often.' -- Winston Churchill*

> *'Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.' -- Gandhi*

> *'As much as possible, try to apply your knowledge in some form of experiment or practice. If not is educational porn.'*

The path to [mastery](#on-mastery) is a never ending story: skills are perishable.

Just in time learning. You can learn faster if you have something your working on rather than some future idea that may not happen. Improves retention, wastes less time.

<!-- 
“We must suffer one of two pains, either the pain of discipline or the pain of regret and disappointment.”
there are consequences for acting and don't acting
-->



===
###On having mentors

Mentors are your best source of feedback. Feedback speeds up improvement.

> *'Follow the thought leaders instead of the traffic leaders.'*

> *'I’d rather have criticism from a genius than praise from an idiot.'*

<!--
+ - =
find somebody smarter than you to teach you and learn something
equal to you to challenge you
less than you that you can teach and learn something
-->



===
###On learning by practice

You learn by getting out of your comfort zone.<br>
Don't be afraid of [failure](#on-mistakes-and-failure).

> *'Make the mind tougher by exposing it to adversity.'*

> *'What gives value to travel is fear.' -- Albert Camus*

> *'Lessons not learned in blood are soon forgotten.'*

> *'Tell me and I’ll forget; show me and I may remember; involve me and I’ll understand.' -- Chinese proverb*

> *'Welcome the attacks of your enemies for how much they improve your work and toughen you up.'*

<!--
deliberated practice

The Things That Scare You the Most Are the Things You Most Need to Do
Let your fears guide you.

I'm not a risk taker, I'm just stupid.
mitigate risks. some people just have larger comfort zones.
in new situations sometimes we don't know what risks are.
when expanding comfort zones you are learning.

what happens when we step too far out of our comfort zones, how James mitigates risk by assuming the worst, how experience with failure can be a valuable skillset, why being in debt is better than simply being broke, and lots more.
-->



===
###On learning by theory

You learn by analysis of past situations.

> *'Fools say that they learn by experience, I prefer to profit by others’ experience.' -- Otto von Bismarck*

> *'Every day, with every action and choice, you're either a teacher and an inspiration, or a lesson and a reminder.'*

> *'Practice makes perfect but doesn't make new. New comes from having a broader perspective.'*

<a id="on-meditation"></a>Take moments to be reflective. It will help you letting go [past failures](#on-mistakes-and-failure) and get [relaxed](#on-being-relaxed).

> *'Journal early before your inhibitions take in.'*

> *'Keep a journal to record the lessons you learn in life. You’ll get more out of life and you’ll make less of the same mistakes. A journal, scotch, and a little music will give you more deep thoughts than you want.'*

> *'All truly great thoughts are conceived by walking.' -- Nietzsche*

<!--
people repeat very easily the same mistakes. you improve by working at it.
you learn from failure. examine your failures, people write books about it. 

you can only connect the dots looking back, not looking forward

career day an year -> journaling self analysis.

am i learning? if not you'll have a problem down the road.

2. To Lead a Balanced and Healthy Life You Need to Ask the Right Questions
Tony Robbins says that the quality of your life is based on the quality of the questions that you ask yourself.
If you are facing health struggles, you need to ask yourself these three questions to truly uncover the root cause of the issues in your life.
1) What Are You Holding On To?What happened in your life that you are still angry, depressed, or frustrated with? What are you really holding onto that is holding you back.
2) What is Life trying to Teach You?How can you reframe the thing that you are holding onto into something good? What is life trying to teach you through that struggle.
3) How Can I Move On?What steps do you need to take to move on with your life? Who do you need to forgive, what needs to be said, who needs to be removed from your life?

Write advice to yourself or other people. Review it regularly. Edit it. Refine it. It worked for Marcus Aurelius and it worked for Bruce Lee.
I’ve started a list of advice or things I know. Perhaps things I believe I know. Some of these are lessons I’ve learned the hard way, others are lessons I’ve observed in others. This process reminds us of what’s most important and helps us to avoid making the same mistakes in the future. I will edit and add to this over time. Try making your own list and I think it will be worth your time.
-->



===
###On mastery

First learn the rules. Then break them.<br>
You achieve mastery with a mix of [practice](#on-learning-by-practice) and [theory](#on-learning-by-theory).

> *'Masters are able to ask the kinds of simple questions that most people pass over.'*

> *'The very desire to find shortcuts makes you eminently unsuited for any kind of mastery.'*

> *'An expert is someone who knows some of the worst mistakes that can be made in his subject, and how to avoid them.' -- Werner Heisenberg*

> *'You want to learn every aspect of that subject, you are expected to be a pro. There is no place for a prima donna.'*

<!-- You must have control over your work and you must enjoy it in order to be successful at it in the long term. -->

HOWEVER, mastery is the main trigger of [arrogance](#on-arrogance). There's always room for improvement: be [humble](#on-humbleness).

> *'I am not young enough to know everything.' -- Oscar Wilde*

> *'How often our early triumphs turn us into a kind of caricature of ourselves.'*

> *'If you gain any kind of attention or success for your work, you face the great danger of creeping conservatism.'*



===
###On being a mentor

Your father is your first mentor. Be a mentor yourself and share your strengths. Impact the world.

> *'One repays a teacher badly if one remains only a pupil.' -- Nietzsche*

> *'Powerful people give freely, buying influence rather than things.'*

> *'A society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit in.' -- Greek proverb*

<!--
mix with guerrilla thinking

6 - i don't tell my boys them how to live. i live fully and let them see.
-->
> *'If you think you're too small to make an impact, try to go to bed with a mosquito in the room.'*

> *'The best way to cheer yourself up is to try to cheer someone else up.' -- Mark Twain*

> *'Play on people’s need to believe to create a cult-like following.' -- Robert Greene (27th law of power)*

HOWEVER, some people are not ready to have a mentor and accept your vision. Accept it.

> *'Do not teach a starving man to fish.'*

> *'Never waste your time trying to explain who you are to people who are committed to misunderstanding you.' -- Dream Hampton*

Fear is paralyzing. To overcome it, replace fear of unknown with curiosity.

> *'If you view everything through the lens of fear, then you tend to stay in retreat mode.'*

> *'Don’t be afraid to be alone. Don’t be afraid to be committed. Fear is the most limiting quality a person has.' -- Michelangelo*

> *'You always have two choices: your commitment versus your fear.' -- Sammy Davis Jr.*

> *'The things we fear the most have already happened to us.'*

Excuses are a manifestation of fear. None of them is acceptable. End.

> *'You cannot use your personality type as an excuse.'*

> *'You'll never be as young as you are today.'*

<!--
There is no coming to consciousness without pain. People will do anything, no matter how absurd, in order to avoid facing their own Soul.

you'll never have fear of loss when you give more value to lessons than successes.

###On mistakes and failure

Sometimes you win. Sometimes you learn. Accept failure as part of the process.<br>
Fail fast and bounce back quickly by being [grateful](#on-gratefulness-and-happiness).

> *'Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new.'*

> *'The greatest mistake you can make in life is to continually be afraid you will make one.' -- Elbert Hubbard*

> *'A scar is not an injury. A scar is an healing. After an injury, a scar is what makes you whole.' -- China Mieville*

> *'Repeated failure will toughen your spirit and show you with absolute clarity how things must be done.'*

> *'You are more than your mistakes. Your past mistakes are meant to guide you, not to define you.'*

> *'Making mistakes is better than faking perfections.'*

> *'Be gentle first with yourself.'*

> *'The more you fail, the more you learn.'*

> *'When you don't know something you will pay for it. That's the stupidity tax.'*



===
###On shame

Speaking openly about an imperfection is a sign of strength, not a weakness.<br>
You are not you think you are: *you are what you hide*.

<!--
you can hide the ugly parts, but you can't make them disappear
-->

> *'Imperfections are attractive when their owners are happy with them.' -- Augusten Burroughs*

> *'Comfort in our failures allows us to act without fear, to engage without judgment, to love without conditions.'*

> *'Once you’ve accepted your flaws, no one can use them against you.' -- Tyrion*

> *'It takes more courage to reveal your insecurities than to hide them.' -- Alex Karras*

> *'Being entirely honest with oneself is an important exercise.' -- Sigmund Freud*

> *'What you fear you attract; what you resist, you make it bigger.'*

> *'Just get out of the room.' -- Robert Glover*

> *'Shame corrodes the very part of us that believes we are capable of change.' -- Brene Brown*

> *'Nobody feels love when they feel shame.' -- John Townsend*



===
###On confidence and validation

Don’t wait for someone else to tell you that you are special. If the universe didn't need you, you wouldn't be here.

> *'You should look at rejection as a tool that reveals incompatibility instead of evidence of your unworthiness or inadequateness.'*

> *'Having a low opinion of yourself is not modesty. It’s self-destruction.' -- Bobby Sommer*

> *'Value yourself. The only people who appreciate a doormat are people with dirty shoes.' -- Leo Buscaglia*

If you say it with confidence, you are who you say you are.

> *'You're only as good as your next speech.'*

> *'A speech is a performance. Authenticity is crucial.'*

> *'Believe you can, and you’re half way there.'*

[Mastery](#on-mastery) and [core values](#on-identity) are good sources of confidence.<br>
In the meanwhile any source is good. Don't stop till you get it.

> *'If you don't believe in yourself. Believe in me who believes in you.'*

> *'Fake it till you make it.'*

<a id="on-arrogance"></a>HOWEVER, know the frontier between confidence and arrogance.

> *'Confidence is not walking into a room thinking you are better than everyone, it's walking in not having to compare yourself with anyone at all.'*

> *'Ego is the enemy. People say that you can't fly and then you flew. Then you think you are God.'*

<!-- 
> *'Presence is confidence without arrogance, grounded enthusiasm and comfortable behavior. Authenticity can't be faked.'*

Confidence is a result, not a requirement

Your belief that you are not good enough, that you will never find a woman as good as your current girlfriend, or that other men will be able to care for her and satisfy her better than you will

impostor syndrome

> *'Controlling the impression that you make on others takes a large amount of cognitive bandwidth and everything will appear as fake.'*

> *'Arrogance is a smokescreen for insecurity.' -- Amy Cuddy*



===
###On limits

> *'Your limits are where are your fears.'*

> *'Your beliefs determine your reality. Nothing can sabotage you more quickly and more completely than limiting beliefs.'*

> *'The only person standing in your way is you.' -- Black Swan

HOWEVER

> *'We don’t rise to the level of our expectations; we fall to the level of our [training](#on-mastery).'*

> *'Your level of success will seldom exceed your level of personal development.'*



===
###On health

Take care of your body. It’s the most important thing you’ll get for free.<br>
But the origin of most health problems is not physical.

> *'There are links between mental health and physical health. Physical stress avoids need for control.'*

> *'Body language affects your psychology, your mood, and even your hormonal balance.'*

> *'Action cures everything. Plain and simple.'*

Stress is caused by under-stimulation or over-stimulation.

> *'Under-stimulation (boredom) / right amount of stress (hustling = stretching comfort zone) / over-stimulation (anxiety)'*

By worrying about the [past](#on-past) or the [future](#on-future);

<!--
- The cure for worry? Presence (as recently discussed with Amy Cuddy, author of Presence: Bringing Your Boldest Self to Your Biggest Challenges). Focus on the task at hand. Face forward, but don’t live in the pretend future where the thing you’re fearing wins.
-->

> *'If you are depressed you are living in the past. <br>
If you are anxious you are living in the future. <br>
If you are at peace you are living in the present.' -- Lao Tzu*

<!-- ligar com #on-control -->

> *'Anxiety is linked with our wired out evolutionarily for a [need of control](#on-control). Anxiety is not planning, anxiety is to go on continuously over any kind of scenario. Past is only in your head. What's important is present and future. We don't control anything, at most we influence some stuff.'*

> *'Anxiety and depression are symptoms, not diseases.'*

> *'Worry is a misuse of the imagination.'*

> *'Stress is caused by giving a fuck.'*

<!--
> *'Financial health is just as important as physical health.'*
 -->

<a id="on-being-relaxed"></a>The more relaxed you are, the better you are at everything.

> *'If you are feeling stressed out.. Breathe.'*

> *'If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it; and this you have the power to revoke at any moment.'*

> *'Memories need sleep to get consolidated. Sleep deprivation is bad for memory. Stress also.'*

> *'I've decided to be happy because it is good to my health.'*

<!-- 
You can’t perform under pain, stress, etc. without adequate capacity. That capacity is physical.

You mind is a made of physical things. Neurons, chemicals, electricity. Your physical state, capacity for physical stress, sleep, diet, experiences, determine the bulk of your mental state. Do not rely upon cognition to make change. Behavior and the physical world are your key to changing affect and cognition. Your mental performance IS physical performance.

> *'Balance on body training = flexibility (yoga or animal movements) + strength (weights)'*

> *'If I had to prescribe two things to improve health and happiness in the world, it’s movement and play.' -- Jason Nemer*

When most people are struggling with pain, they fail to realize that often times, their pain is caused by a mental or emotional problem and not a physical problem. This could stem from a childhood trauma, a tragic event, or simply a personal insecurity.
Reframe Your Pain and Become Grateful 
The simple truth is, it is hard to be in pain when you are in a state of gratitude and love. 5. Release the Pain. Be grateful for how it helped you become the man you are, but accept that you no longer need it in your life and let it go.

If you feel powerless/being dominated you will be chronically stressed.

###On networking

Don't [isolate](#on-neutrality-and-isolation) yourself. The people you know and whether they like you will determine what opportunities you get.<br>

> *'To develop your intellectual powers at the expense of the social is to retard your own progress to mastery.'*

> *'You’re never too old to make a friend. Always be looking for a new one.'*

> *'If a buddy calls and needs to get a drink, go. No matter the hour, how busy you are, or what else you have going on.'*

> *'Play the perfect courtier.' -- Robert Greene (24th law of power)*

> *'The purpose of high education is first and foremost to meet people and build relationships.'*

Social inadequacy AKA creepiness is based on unpredictability. 

prepare an elevator pitch

building a network is critical

Regarding networking adding value is everything

if people forget it wasn't a good network anyway

A person starts to live when he can live outside himself. Be in the moment instead of being in your head.

network --
raw connections
community of experts (that give you good answers)
critical colleagues (10 people that make a big difference in your immediate career) - boss / boss's boss

ask advice to a person that you know, everybody says that you're the best to explain that. people will like you more

build rapport - cut the BS. speak whats in your mind, sometimes it backfires. be real

> *'on networking: expand from too dense networks. custom tailor teams from project to project. same team from same project is not the best option. if anybody in your list knows everybody is a big pro

###On listening and speaking

Speak less and listen more: be [humble](#on-humbleness). Listening is powerful.

> *'Listen to many, speak to a few.' -- William Shakespeare*

> *'People don’t listen, they just wait for their turn to talk.' -- Chuck Palahniuk*

> *'Listen to predict a collapse.'*

> *'Arguing as you're right. Listening as you're wrong.'*

> *'You can never be sure who you are dealing with. A man who is of little importance and means today can be a person of power tomorrow.'*

<!--
> *'Judge a man by his questions, not by his answers.'*
-->

Learn how to talk to people:<br> 
Smile, don't ramble, look for external catalysts as hints for stories and questions, talk about your passions instead of your accomplishments, never be stubborn and listen.

> *'Rambling and not smiling are two things to get better speaking to anybody.'*

> *'Get better asking questions. They are more important than answers.'*

> *'Talk about your passions instead of your accomplishments (aka bragging), transform it in a story.'*

> *'Storytelling is about the details.'*

> *'On improvisation is more productive to say «yes and» instead of «yes but». Get rid of ego and add value. Don't judge.'*

> *'Know how to lead a conversation and how to go with the conversational flow. Get out of your head and become more situationally aware, always looking for external catalysts.'*

> *'You don't always have to get the last word. Make your point and leave it that way. Let go.'*



===
###On relationships

Relationships are based on [trust](#on-trust-and-integrity).

> *'A great relationship is about finding the similarities and respect the differences.'*

> *'Focus on what you can give not what you can get. You only receive in proportion to what you give.'*

<!--
first we judge trust, before strength
we build trust through presence. leadership is based on trust.

> *'If a person is nice to you and to nobody else, that person is not nice.'*
-->

HOWEVER, after taking the first step [mirror](#on-mirroring) their behavior.

> *'Don't hide your feelings from people who show you theirs.'*

> *'Forget those who forget you. Those who want to stay in your life, will always find a way.'*

Run away from mediocrity. Be ready to loose people.

> *'If you are lonely when you are not alone, you are in bad company.'*

> *'Humans make connections. Sometimes these connections grow. Sometimes they stay the same. Sometimes they collapse.'*

> *'The free soul is rare, but you know it when you see it - basically because you feel good, very good, when you are near or with them.' -- Charles Bukowski*

> *'You loose your identity, you loose people.' -- Amy Cuddy*

> *'Don't let people that are bad influences to put you down.'*



===
###On lovers

> *'Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength, while loving someone deeply gives you courage.' -- Lao Tzu*

> *'Every person feels loved in a different form.'*

> *'Never love anyone that treats you like you're ordinary.'*

> *'On a serious conversation with a SO, instead of generalizing, talk about three things:<br>
First, your observations, or what you have noticed is happening in your relationship.<br>
Next talk about how the observation has made you feel. Finally, discuss your values.'*

<!--
keep separate bank accounts.
> *'Spouses should have the freedom and autonomy to buy what they want, but only after bills are automatically paid. People value things differently. Having to justify every expense makes you feel like you’re being watched. This breeds resentment. Most marriages end in divorce, most of them over money.'* 

If you are struggling in your relationships, odds are, you are withholding your truth from your woman.
You need to open up, tell her the truth, be honest with her without fear of outcome and without any neediness from her.

> *'love me when i least deserve it, because that's when i really need it.' -- Swedish proverb*

> *'Men experience many passions in a lifetime. One passion drives away the one before it.' -- Paul Newman.'*
-->



===
###On family

> *'Cleave from your family but then come back. You need to be independent and loyal at the same time.'*



===
###On peers

You will waste your life trying to make those around into who you want them to be. Instead change who you are around.<br>
You are the average of the people you surround yourself.

> *'Infection: avoid the unhappy and unlucky.' -- Robert Greene (10th law of power)*

Keep your friends for friendship but work with the skilled and competent.

<!-- 
> *'If you're the smartest in the room, you're in the wrong room.'*

you're never a prophet in your homeland.

> *'Nobody wants to be the best player in the band.'*

working with friends is not good, because there will be always problems of fixing hierarchy. peers are peers not boss and employee.

Get proximity to successful, happy, and rich people. Be cool. They will likely influence you automatically.
-->

> *'Work friends are just that, work friends. Nothing more.'*

> *'Never put too much trust in friends, learn how to use enemies.' -- Robert Greene (2nd law of power)*

> *'Your friends are the ones that go to your funeral, in a day of rain.'*



===
###On higher ranks

> *'Never outshine the master.' -- Robert Greene (1st law of power)*

> *'Know who you’re dealing with: do not offend the wrong person.' -- Robert Greene (9th law of power)*

> *'Avoid stepping into a great man’s shoes.' -- Robert Greene (41st law of power)*

HOWEVER, don't vow to the gatekeepers.

<!--
Most people are basically afraid of their superiors. Someone’s position does not make them important. You can replace them as quickly as they can replace you. There is infinite opportunity right in front of you. You do not need them. You are choosing to do business with them as they are choosing to do business with you, making you both equals.

###On criticism and envy

Ignore and be flattered by envy. Reduce envy by not appearing [too perfect](#on-outliers).

> *'The dogs bark but the caravan moves on.' -- Arab proverb*

> *'Don’t argue your path with other people. Walk it.' -- lazy yogi*

> *'Never hate people who are jealous of you, but respect their jealousy. They think that you're better than them.'*

> *'When people criticize your life they are speaking about their one fears and limitations not yours.'*

> *'When critics get together they talk about form, structure and meaning. When artists get together they talk about where you can buy cheap solvent.'*

> *'Só há consensos no 1º e no ultimo minuto de algo.'*

HOWEVER, beware of blindspots, not all criticism is envy.

> *'When somebody says something bad about you, is negativity. When everyone says it, is advice.'*

> *'If too many users are wrong, it's probably your fault.'*

> *'The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing.'*



===
###On outliers

Outliers inspire envy. [Intelligence](#on-intelligence), [wealth](#on-wealth), [ambition](#on-ambition-and-motivation), [fame](#on-fame), [luck](#on-luck) and [beauty](#on-beauty) are the main triggers. 

> *'Never appear too perfect.' -- Robert Greene (46th law of power)*

> *'Great spirits have always found violent opposition from mediocrities. The latter cannot understand it when a man does not thoughtlessly submit to hereditary prejudices but honestly and courageously uses his intelligence.' -- Albert Einstein*

You’re judged by what you do, not what you think.

> *'Think as you like but behave like others.' -- Robert Greene (38th law of power)*

> *'If A is a success in life, then A equals x plus y plus z. Work is x; y is play; and z is keeping your mouth shut.' -- Albert Einstein*

> *'Have exactly one vice. Two is too much. None makes you boring. Drink cocktails. Beer is for uncreative people.'*

<!-- 
Jealousy stems from your own limiting beliefs.

> *'They called her witch because she knew how to heal herself.'*
-->



===
###On herd mentality

Most people are other people. Their thoughts are someone else opinions.

> *'Common sense is the collection of prejudices acquired by age eighteen.'*

> *'People accept the defaults very easily.'*

> *'Gold rushes make the shovel sellers rich, not the gold seekers.'*

<!--
There are no smart people or stupid people, just people being smart or being stupid.
Being smart means thinking things through - trying to find the real answer, not the first answer.
Being stupid means avoiding thinking by jumping to conclusions. Jumping to a conclusion is like quitting a game : you lose by default.
That’s why saying “I don’t know” is usually smart, because it’s refusing to jump to a conclusion.
So when someone says “They are so stupid!” - it means they’ve stopped thinking.

So if you decide someone is stupid, it means you’re not thinking, which is not being smart.
Therefore: smart people don’t think others are stupid.
-->

HOWEVER, common sense is not so common.

###On leadership

Being a leader is different from being a boss. Leadership is based on [trust](#on-trust-and-integrity).

> *'A leader is best when people barely know he exists, when his work is done, his aim fulfilled, they will say: we did it ourselves.' -- Lao Tzu*

> *'The secret to motivating people and maintaining their morale is to get them to think less about themselves and more about the group.'*

> *'If you want to lead, simply act with confidence and others around you will pick up on that energy and fall in line. No explicit statements needed. If someone fails to fall in line, either your leadership needs improvement or you need to excise them from your group.'*

> *'Be royal in your own fashion: act like a king to be treated like one.' -- Robert Greene (34th law of power)*

> *'People don't follow robots.'*

> *'There are no bad teams, only bad leaders.'*

> *'No one is smarter than a small group.'*

People want leadership because they want autonomy and influence.

> *'The person who clears the path ultimately controls its direction, just as the canvas shapes the painting.' -- Ryan Holiday*

> *'Influence is more powerful than money. The reason millionaires are depressed is that they don’t know the difference.'*

HOWEVER,

> *'Keep your attempts at intimidation under control. Be careful not to become intoxicated by the power fear brings.'*

Refuse to work with people you don’t like.
Fire customers that cause you to much stress or that cost too much to service.
It takes a very small number of people (one) to ruin an environment. One person in the office is all it takes to make everyone miserable. Don’t tolerate these people. Take it as far as you need to take it. 

In order to be successful you will probably have to build a team of successful people to support you. You need them to be paid well and well taken care of. You must make it easy for them to succeed and you must teach them how to do it. You won’t do it alone. Put employees before customers. Owners make more than employees in the long run.

We advance the welfare of others — often unconsciously — by sharing resources, cooperating, and collaborating within a social structure. As perhaps an unintended consequence, we find ourselves gaining power. Most often, this power is something that’s given to us, and not something we set out to seize. This runs directly counter to the popular belief that power is attained by becoming a Machiavellian super villain and using force, manipulation, deception, and strategic ruthlessness to take it at the expense of others.
Individuals demonstrating value to other individuals — or companies demonstrating value to a society — gain power as a direct result.

When someone is out of line, don’t let it slide too far.
If you let someone treat your poorly for too long in order to avoid conflict, things will get so bad that you then have to have a huge fight in order to correct them. What could have been very small is now a real problem that may compromise your relationship, business, etc.

Always be clear and specific about what you expect from other people. You can not expect from them what you haven’t articulated…usually many times and in writing. Also plan for them to fail you.

###On communication

Management is about communication.<br>
Being a leader requires to be equal parts manager and psychotherapist.

> *'Instead of generalizing and saying «management is useless», it's more correct to say «bad management is counterproductive».'*

> *'Spend 1 hour a day just talking to your people and everything will be OK.'*

> *'The goal is to move everyone up from «unconfident and incompetent» to «confident and competent». Some people also go through «incompetent and confident», «where the best option is often to stand back and act as a safety net while letting the person learn whatever lesson they needed to learn.' -- exelius*

> *'Start a meeting with an overachieving question: «how can we raise sales by 12%?»'*

Don't add your two cents, specially on subjective stuff, unless you're certain the delivered work is not good enough.<br>
If feedback is needed, give a reason.

> *'Try «can you take another look at this for XYZ reasons?». This gives the employee ownership of the final deliverable, while still prompting them to deal with problems they overlooked.'*

> *'«Because» is a great motivator.'*

And ask instead of telling.

> *'«Why did you decide to do X in that order?». This creates a dialog, instead of a debate where each side first stakes out positions. Lead your people to discover what you would have suggested. Smart people will get to the same place you were going, or you may learn something, if you are humble enough to listen.'*

> *'Make pertinent questions as: <br>
«Is that the best you can do?» <br>
«Interesting, how do you feel about it?» <br>
«What does your team think?»'*

In any case, [humility](#on-identity) is needed for leadership. Pounding directives down or not giving any direction are demotivators for your junior people. Gaining an understanding and giving appropriate feedback makes your juniors feel like what they are doing is important.



===
###On delegation

Managing is delegating. Your speed as a manager is the speed of the team.<br>

> *'A manager should make himself 2 questions a day: <br>
«What is important to accomplish?» (where are you going) <br>
«Where was I uncomfortable the day before?» (what went right and where do you need support) <br>
The speed that you offload your stuff will be the speed of your team.'*

> *'If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.' -- African proverb*

> *'Your productivity as a manager is measured as the productivity of your team. Being seated making stuff is not productive.
The key principle is putting your team’s productivity first. Remember, you are a communication hub and a multiplier. Think about the things you can delegate vs. the things that only you can do. If you truly work for your people instead of hiding at your desk, just tell yourself: what I accomplished today is not yet visible, but it will be.'*

Productivity is different from workflow engineering.

> *'Don’t postpone to tomorrow what other people can do for you today.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'Be productive, not cheap. Stop dicking around trying to figure stuff out that someone else already knows.'*

> *'Start as close to the end as possible.' -- Kurt Vonnegu*

<!--
And use deep work

> *'Too busy pretending I'm occupied.'*

###On hiring and keeping talent

Hire anyone but only retain the best.

> *'He who works with his hands is a laborer.<br>
He who works with his hands and his head is a craftsman.<br>
He who works with his hands and his head and his heart is an artist.' --  St. Francis of Assisi*

> *'2 valid methods: hiring on culture contribution and hiring on culture matching.'*

> *'Trust someone if they say they are human and susceptible to conflicts of interest but actively avoiding such conflicts.'*

How to keep talented people? Respect them.<br>
You'll never respect them if you don't pay them accordingly.

###On being hired

Employers hire you because you are a likable person that «get shit done».

> *'When applying for a job be more of a consultant than an applicant.'*

> *'Bad professionals make money off their customers, good professionals make money for their customers.' -- Jacques Mattheij*

> *'Your work is the greatest mean at your disposal for expressing your social intelligence.'*

HOWEVER, companies don't care about you. Having a job is risky, avoid the trap of following one set career path.

> *'I work for money, if you want loyalty hire a dog.'*

> *'If your job doesn't require originality, next decade you might not have one.'*

> *'The moment you [rigidly follow a plan](#on-adapting) set in your youth, you lock yourself into a position, and the times will ruthlessly pass you by.'*

> *'The interesting jobs are the ones that you make up.' -- Chris Young*

<!--
people pivot to near areas, combining two skills, mixing matching and combining
find mentors, even virtual mentors: a good book

there is this gap from where you are and where you want to be. this gap is the place from where you have to come back. and know the worse it can happen
a really dj has to know how to clear the floor

deep work - will promote you
shallow work - will prevent you from getting fired

career capital - unique skills that make you rare and valuable

deep work - be so good that they can't ignore you

career fuel in the first 15 years
1) transportable skills: soft skills
persuasive communication. hard skills / 
write a pitch, are u persuasive, can you change somebody else opinion. making a 2 minute youtube, etc
emotional intelligence
ability to read the room
ability to build trust
magnet, be able to retain talent, who wants to work for you
2) question: talent ledger: what are people that were working for them.
top leaders ask for help and give knowledge away. more open source.
3) take risks to boost your immune system

differentiate yourself / volunteer for an assignment
becoming the go to guy for some questions

return to an workplace
- reframe your experience. use today and future jargons. make your homework.
- refresh your skill set, if you got rusty.
- career ecosystems - get back into them reconnect
- reboot self confidence ??? surround yourself with confident people

people will describe your strengths if you ask them why did you ask him for an interview.
than work from there.

###On business

To make money is to add value.<br>
Focus on areas where you are motivated to add value but be realistic when choosing your market.

> *'What you need to start a new business: generosity.' -- Derek Sivers*

> *'Focus on what can you give instead of focusing in making money. Find your market and you'll get the reward.'*

> *'Money is energy.'*

> *'Money is the expression of your creativity.'*

> *'To make money focus on the fun.'*

> *'Scratch your own itch.'*

> *'In some complex and mature markets if you start too small you will never be able to compete with existent players. «Starting up in a garage» works mostly on new and undeveloped markets.'*

Validate your business by finding paying clients.

> *'Without customers, you don’t have a business. You have a hobby.' -- Don Peppers & Martha Rogers*

> *'The consumer votes with his wallet.'*

> *'Test sales first. If something is worth doing, sales will come easy and dollars will be high. If you have to drag people along kicking and screaming, you’re wasting your time. If they were in, they'd be in on day one.'*

> *'In general, it's not about what you know, it's about who trusts you to solve their problems.<br>
Often, that requires the technical skills to reliably solve their problems.<br>
Always, that requires the communication skills to persuade someone you can solve their problems.'*

Successful *entrepreneurs* are good managing risk.<br>
HOWEVER they have extended comfort zones: low risk for them might mean high risk for you.

> *'Entrepreneurs prepare for bad. They budget pessimistically using the worst case scenario.'*

> *'Be cautious. Entrepreneurs normally take a big risk and offset it with cautious moves (e.g. day job). Entrepreneurs are more risk averse than general population.'*

> *'Startup fortune cookie: That company that seems so interested in buying you won't.'*

<!--
Do things manually at first.
You don’t have to build an elaborate system to get started. Get one client and do everything the hard way. Only after business is over running your ability to do things manually do you have to worry about automation.
Use scripts or software to do what you would normally do manually, but only after you have established success manually. Don’t put a bunch of effort in on the front end to find out there’s no demand. Then productize. Automate. Streamline. Checklists and procedures to remove any thought from the equation.

When evaluating an idea make sure the math scales
- If you’re looking for a restaurant location, look at how many seats, average price of meal, average turnover time, multiply it out. Will even max capacity pay the rent?
- How many potential sales, how much does it cost to reach them, what is a conversion rate to expect?
- How much can you produce in an hour, will that ever pay you enough?
- Is the price high enough?
- Are the costs low enough?

It's not even about marketing, just building something of actual value. I doubt this girl has spent much if anything on marketing.

zona genius: only 3 things I'm allowed to do in my business, the things that really serve us and we good at it
top 5 list you do, the rest is avoid at all cost list.
genius area / excellence area / competence area / incompetence area

how to purge to do list and focus right now
- does this need to be done regarding my business? Y/N
- does this be needed by me? Y/N
- does this need to be done now? Y/N
Most items were already purged.

###On selling and persuasion

We're all in sales. You're in sales anytime you interact with anybody.

Sales used to be about information asymmetry but times are changing.<br>
It's now mostly applied persuasion and keeping relationships.

> *'When you go up in an hierarchy you the need of persuasion is higher.<br>
To persuade up, focus in interests; to persuade down focus in emotions.'*

> *'Historically, the seller had more information than the buyer. 
Its a different game now. Everybody knows immediately the alternatives.'*

> *'Selling by just keeping in touch. send emails once in a while.'*

<!--
irritation -> challenge people to make something that they don't want to do
agitation -> challenge people to make something that they want to do. suggesting ego etc

agitate more than irritate

mimicking people gestures and words works!

So can you pitch me what our company does?

people minds work by association.
pre-suasion

use testimonials that allow people to see themselves in that testimony
people are intrigued by mystery! stories!

get to objections

best sellers are ambiverts.

===
###On buying

> *'Pay too much for everything. The effort spent getting a deal is only a distraction and attention is your most limited resource.' -- Allen Tucker*



===
###On negotiation

To negotiate is to have options.<br>
Negotiate while advancing. The more you take, the more you can give back in meaningless concessions.

> *'Control the options: get others to play with the cards you deal.' -- Robert Greene (31st law of power)*

> *'When people feel they have a choice, they walk into your trap that much more easily.'*

> *'When asking for help, appeal to people’s self-interest, never to their mercy or gratitude.' -- Robert Greene (13th law of power)*

Never negotiate with binary questions: 

> *'«What can you do?» instead of «Will you do this?»'*

Best way to say no:

> *'«How am I supposed to do that?». «How» gives people an opportunity to show how smart they are.'*

Tone of voice is a big clue to know with whom we are negotiating:

> *'The analytical cold guy is very patient; <br>
The assertive guy (eg. Trump) wants to make it fast; <br>
For the accomodator, the relationship is the most important'*

<!-- 
> *'Unexpressed feelings never die.'*
> *'Releasing pressure is different from venting.'*
> *'The more influence somebody is the more they use we / plural pronouns.'*
> *'There are so many wingman breaking communication. looking for cliches, profanity, adjectives, emotions, whats important for them, body language.'*
> *'Listening for things that you didn't see. for incongruence.'*
> *'They will hurt, and than say what you have to say. people then are expecting and it doesn't hurt as much.'*
naming the negatives first.'* 

REMeMBER PEOPLE THAT THEY HAVE CHOICES, That they can control.

never split the difference

Negotiate contracts in minute detail on the front end so that you aren’t negotiating after work is done, investments are made, and you have no bargaining power. This is especially important if the relationship between people is important as it avoids conflict later on.
-->

> *'On negotiation you don't need to match the other person mood, you should be playful and smart, taking the other to mirror your good mood also.'*

> *'mirroring and reword. repeating the last one to three words of the other person. it opens up people's brain. Its' very effective.'*test the firmness of what they want. the others had to think about it. people didn't even realize it.'*

<!-- 
> *'Instead of generalizing, stick with the facts.'* 
-->

HOWEVER, always strive to achieve a win-win situation. The deal will fall if both sides don't take what they need from it.

> *'Peace cannot be kept by force. It can only be achieved by understanding.'*

> *'You can’t make a good deal with a bad person.'*



===
###On price

[Negotiation](#on-negotiation) establishes the price (exchange rate between money and value).
That said, a bad/good negotiation means that you are adding more/less value to the world than receiving money for it.

###On analysis

Analysis is an art, not a science.

> *'To find deep truths intuition is better than statistics.'*

> *'Statistics are like bikinis. What they reveal is suggestive, but what they conceal is vital.' -- Levenstein*

> *'«Dictator's dilemma»:  when the vote goes 79% – 21% for some candidate we presume it was fair and represents a popular mandate. But when his excellency and Great Father of his People, gets 97% of the vote we say that is BS.'*

And, as such, error-prone: bias, being [misled](#on-deceiving) and randomness will trigger miscalculations.

> *'Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts.'*

> *'What Susie says of Sally says mores about Susie than of Sally.'*

> *'«Chekov bottle»: If something is described in a previous chapter, it means it will be important for the action in a future chapter.'*

> *'Most facts are a «tell» but some are just random.'*

> *'Never assume that what people say or do in a particular moment is a statement of their permanent desires.'*

> *'The highest form of the art of power is the ability to distinguish the wolves from the lambs, the foxes from hares, the hawks from vultures.'*

HOWEVER, bias is everywhere. Be specially careful when facing new ideas.<br>
Too much info is also prone to bias: you'll always find confirmation to your pre-existing beliefs and assumptions.

> *'Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth.'*

> *'The hardest thing to explain is the glaringly evident that everyone has decided not to see.' -- Ayn Rand*

> *'You always get exaggerated notions of things you don’t know anything about.' -- Albert Camus*

> *'An unfamiliar city is a fine thing. That’s the time and place when you can suppose that all of the people you meet are nice.' -- Louis Céline*

> *'Each generation imagines itself to be more intelligent than the one that went before it, and wiser than the one that comes after it.' -- Orwell*

> *'Nothing is as simple at seems at first, or as hopeless as it seems in the middle, or as finished as it seems in the end.'*

> *'I am both worse and better than you thought.' -- Sylvia Plath*



===
###On decision making

<!--
refazer 

decisions are affected by memory
-->

> *'May your choices reflect your choices, not your [fears](#on-fear-and-excuses).' -- Nelson Mandela*

> *'I am not a product of my circumstances. I am a product of my decisions.' -- Stephen Cove*

> *'You have choices. Choices are experiments.'*

> *'Decisions are made based on memory. There are 3 routes: reflex (genetics), habits or goals. So influence their memories and you can influence their decisions'*

<!--
Do i need to justify my choice? What am i searching for? functional decision vs emotional decision.

too familiar - too unfamiliar. we like what is in the middle! similar enough and different enough to be liked. the secret is on the [middle](#on-balance)

Do i need to justify my choice? What am i searching for? functional decision vs emotional decision.

Always assume that you’re wrong from a purely philosophical point of view. We are always wrong about whatever we believe. Knowledge is always moving forward, and if you think about things you used to believe 10 years ago or five years ago, it embarrasses you now. And the things that you hold dear and hold to be true today are likely going to embarrass you in 10 or 20 years from now. 

Say no to things you aren’t really excited about doing. Hell yes or no. The mediocre robs you of the great. sivers 

Make decisions about what you want to do ideally on the front end rather than tracking what you do on the back end. Planning a diet vs. recording a diet. Making decisions under stress vs making decisions when relaxed and clear headed.

we think we make choices but our choices are affected by others. (ex of naming a child)
people pick what is familiar. people are influenced without us realizing.
working class want to feel the same as others.
white collar want to feel different from others.
-->

HOWEVER, too many decisions will drain you. Attention is the most limited resource.

> *'Reduce decision making on small tasks to a minimum and do it quickly and in bulk: what to wear, what to eat, etc.'*timi



===
###On planning

Plan ahead and prepare for the highly probable scenarios.<br>
Make the decisions right now. When in the moment of making the decision, you have already done it.

> *'Plan all the way to the end.' -- Robert Greene (29th law of power)*

> *'All battles are won or lost before they are ever fought.' -- Sun Tzu*

> *'The best way to predict the future is to invent it.' -- Alan Kay*

> *'Don’t think too much, you’ll create a problem that wasn’t there in the first place.'*

> *'Someone’s sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'If I had 9 hours to chop down a tree, I'd spend the first six sharpening my ax.' -- Abraham Lincoln*

> *'If you don’t know where you’re going, any road will get you there.' -- Lewis Carroll*

> *'Strategy requires thought; tactics require observation.' -- Max Euwe*

> *'The script is going to be bad but in the end we'll finish eating pizza.'*

HOWEVER, some people get paralyzed by over thinking.

> *'While we are reasoning concerning life, life is gone.' -- David Hume*

<!--
Decide in advance what your time is worth. Do not let others tell you how much you will be paid. They may make offers, but it is never their decision. It is yours.

understand the problem (what is the priority) -> visualize a solution, come out with a plan -> overcomunicate -> adapt to win (the enemy has always a vote

position yourself for victory. long term thinking.

###On creativity and ideas

Always be doing something creative. Your soul won’t survive without it.

> *'The secret to creativity is knowing how to hide your sources.' -- Albert Einstein*

> *'The new is the forgotten because everything has already happened.' -- Arturo Pérez Reverte*

> *'Those who do not want to imitate anything, produce nothing.' -- Salvador Dali*

> *'Good artists copy; great artists steal.' -- Steve Jobs & others*

> *'To invent, you need a good imagination and a pile of junk.' -- Thomas Edison*

> *'Creative minds are rarely tidy.'*

> *'We can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them.'*

> *'Peers (fellow creators) are the best judging ideas. Managers are the worse because they are outcome attached (they will regret more a false positive than a false negative).'*

<!-- 
> *'Moments of originality and moments of conformity.'*

> *'Teach no one your tricks or they will be used against you.'* 

ignorance is a bliss, gives you freedom to think about stuff. being ignorant about the market and the «right way» to do things allows them to come up with creative solutions to problems that experienced veterans would never have thought of. Do not see your ignorance as a curse, see it as a blessing.
-->

> *'We don’t have an «imagination» we have a memory. You cannot «imagine» anything you haven’t seen or heard in your life time.'*

> *'Good ideas are a numbers game. You need a lot of bad ones to get one good.'*

> *'Ideas by themselves are roughly worthless. There's no market for them. There's no place where one can go and buy an idea. Describing your idea in detail doesn't mean other people will copy it. First they'll have to be convinced it's a good idea. If you ever tried to change anyone else's mind you know by now how hard that is. Not even founders themselves can predict how well their own ideas will do. And even if people are convinced your idea is a good idea, they'll still have to compare it to the existing idea they are already working on and see which one they're more likely to do well with.'*



===
###On neutrality and isolation

Neutrality is not possible. Anyway preserve your [freedom](#on-freedom).

<!-- 
Don't avoid conflict. Small conflicts will grow into big conflicts. 

rotten peace
-->

> *'I am either part of the solution or part of the problem.'*

> *'Do not build fortresses to protect yourself: isolation is dangerous.' -- Robert Greene (4th law of power)*

> *'Well-kept gardens die by pacifism.'*

###On timing

Just start.<br>
You cannot afford to wait for inspiration or opportunities, time is the most precious thing you own.<br>
Stop preparing, and start doing. You can learn while you do it.

> *'Stop making resolutions and start making something.'*

> *'Momentum generates motivation.'*

> *'The inspiration you are waiting for, in order to start, is on the other side of starting.'*

> *'You don't have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great.'*

> *'A year from now, you will wish you had started today.' -- Karen Lamb*

> *'If opportunity doesn't knock, build a door.' -- Milton Berle*

> *'Waiting for troubles to come to you will only multiply them and give them a deadly momentum.'*

> *'Enter action with boldness.' -- Robert Greene (28th law of power)*

> *'Go and do the things you can’t. That is how you get to do them.' -- Pablo Picasso*

> *'People procrastinate specially when there are no urgency/deadlines: the panic monster.'*

Timing in important but don't wait for the perfect occasion, a good occasion is a safer bet.<br>
You will languish if you stop for a long time.

> *'Master the art of timing.' -- Robert Greene (35th law of power)*

> *'Did you know you can't steer a boat that isn't moving? Just like a life.' -- Paul Lutus*

HOWEVER, you should have some [plan](#on-planning).

> *'If you are unsure of a course of action, do not attempt it. Your doubts and hesitations will infect your execution.'*

> *'Once you step into a fight that is not of your own choosing, you lose all initiative.'*

<!--
> *'Pressed by circumstances, we feel unusually energized and focused.'*

> *add mark manson on procrastination*

###On pace

Direction is more important than pace.

> *'Speed is useful only if you are running in the right direction.' -- Joel Barker*

> *'If things seem under control, you're just not going fast enough.' -- Mario Andretti*

> *'When you run, make sure you run to something and not away from.' -- The Avett Brothers*

> *'Only fools rush into a situation. By committing too quickly you lose your maneuverability.'*

> *'No matter how great the talent or efforts, some things just take time. You can’t produce a baby in one month by getting nine women pregnant.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'You finished ahead of time, that means you forgot something.'*

<!--
> *'Go-Karts - Feel fast, are slow 747s - Feel slow, are fast Ship it! - Feels fast, is slow Test > *'Document it! - Feels slow, is fast.'*

===
###On focus

First the essential. Then the details.

> *'Concentrate your forces.' -- Robert Greene (23rd law of power)*

> *'In a divided world, power will come from keeping your own group united and cohesive.'*

> *'You can do anything, but not everything.' -- David Allen*

> *'Focusing is about saying no.' -- Steve Jobs*

> *'When life gets blurry, just adjust your focus.'*

> *'It's not what you read, it's what you ignore.' -- Scott Hanselman*

> *'A man with a watch knows what time it is. A man with two watches is never sure.'*

> *'I cannot give you the formula for success, but I can give you the formula for failure, which is: try to please everybody.' -- Herbert Swope*

> *'I want to know God's thoughts; the rest are details.' -- Albert Einstein*

> *'Strike the shepherd and the sheep will scatter.' -- Robert Greene (42nd law of power)*

> *'The ability to ignore immediate dangers and pleasures translates into power.'*

> *'You only have to do a very few things right in your life so long as you don't do too many things wrong.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'Always look where you want to go, not where you don't want to go.'*

> *'Anything that does not bring me alive is too small for me.' -- David Whyte*

HOWEVER, 

> *'The more centralized the enemy, the more devastating becomes a blow at its leader or governing body.'*

<!--

Focus. Do one thing really well. Solve one problem with one solution.
Focus on the one thing most likely to get maximum results. Forget everything else.
-->



===
###On control

Control what you can. Ignore what you can't.

> *'You can lead a horse to water but you can’t make him drink.'*

> *'You can only control yourself. Power comes from that.'*

> *'Control what you’re primed by, who you are around, the ideas and problems you focus on.' -- Allen Tucker*

> *'You want everything to stay the same until you’re ready for it to change. But you can’t do that. You can’t expect the whole world to stand still until you’re ready.' -- Gayle Friesen*

> *'Disdain things you cannot have: ignoring them is the best revenge.' -- Robert Greene (36th law of power)*

<!--
> *'If you change the way you look at things, the thing you look at change' -- Dr. Wayne Dyer*
-->

HOWEVER,

> *'One’s real life is often the life that one does not lead.' -- Oscar Wilde*



===
###On adapting

Plans are not static. Adapt or die.<br>
You need to switch strategies a few times to get where you want to go.

> *'I am a man of fixed and unbending principles, the first of which is to be flexible at all times.' -- Everett Dirksen*

> *'Life is more like tetris than chess.'*

> *'One should not be too straightforward. Go & see the forest. The straight trees are cut down, the crooked ones are left standing.' -- Kautilya*

> *'The most important thing to do if you find yourself in a hole is to stop digging.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'On a plateau take a step back.'*

> *'What got you here won't get you there.'*

> *'The directions to get you anywhere include a few turns:<br>
Sometimes you need to say YES to everything and be open to growth;<br>
Sometimes you need to say NO to everything and focus.<br>
It's scary to make those direction choices, but that's how I know I'm on to something. Fear is a great road sign.'<br>
-- Derek Sivers (adapted)*

> *'To improve is to change; to be perfect is to change often.' -- Winston Churchill*

> *'Whatever space and time mean, place and occasion mean more.' -- Aldo van Eyck*

> *'If I don’t have red, I use blue.' -- Pablo Picasso*

HOWEVER

> *'Preach the need for change, but never reform too much at once.' -- Robert Greene (45th law of power)*



===
###On balance

The dose makes the poison: things in excess become their opposite.<br>
The hardest skill is knowing when to stop.

> *'Do not go past the mark you aimed for; in victory, learn when to stop.' -- Robert Greene (47th law of power)*

> *'The hardest skill is knowing what could be simplified, and what's good enough.'*

> *'Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.'*

> *'Don't take a half step where a full step is required.'*

> *'If half of the room laughs and half doesn't is a success.'*

How to balance an imbalance? Overcompensate.

> *'Overcompensate to make it balanced.' -- Derek Sivers*

> *'Some people get passion from something they struggled with.'*

<!--
You Need to Have Balance in Your Life 

Life is a balancing act.

You can have all the money in the world, but if your home life and health are out of order, you will suffer.
Conversely, you can have a loving family and a shredded body, but if you are not making enough money, you and your loved ones will suffer.
Balance is not about spending the same amount of time focused on every area of your life either.
It is about making progress in all areas of your life and ensuring that you improve just a little bit each day in your health, wealth, relationships, and personal growth.

###On attacking and defending

> *'Keeping your enemies on the defensive and in react mode will have a demoralizing effect on them.'*

> *'If you control the overall direction and framing of the battle, anything they do will play into your hands.'*

<!-- 
> *'Moving first—initiating the attack—will often put you at a disadvantage: you are exposing your strategy and limiting your options.'* 
-->

> *'By seeming stronger than you are, perhaps through an occasional act that is reckless and bold, you can deter the enemy from attacking you.'*

HOWEVER, beware of counter-attacking.

> *'The problems created by an audacious move can be disguised, even remedied, by more and greater audacity.'*

> *'Whenever you find yourself on the defensive and in trouble, the greatest danger is the impulse to overreact.'*



===
###On creating imbalances

Create imbalances in your target to create an advantage and raise chances of winning.<br>
Use methods like [unpredictability](#on-unpredictability), [deceiving](#on-deceiving), [mirroring](#on-mirroring)
and [bait](#on-charming). Some targets may require special tools.



===
###On unpredictability

> *'Appear weak when you are strong, and strong when you are weak.' -- Sun Tzu*

> *'Keep others in suspended terror: cultivate an air of unpredictability.' -- Robert Greene (17th law of power)*

> *'Assume formlessness.' -- Robert Greene (48th law of power)*

> *'Conceal your intention.' -- Robert Greene (3rd law of power)*

HOWEVER, unpredictability can work against you: if you are in a subordinate position, it reduces trust.



===
###On deceiving

> *'Court attention at all cost.' -- Robert Greene (6th law of power)*

> *'Create compelling spectacles.' -- Robert Greene (37th law of power)*

> *'Play to people’s fantasies.' -- Robert Greene (32nd law of power)*

> *'Say less than necessary.' -- Robert Greene (4th law of power)*

> *'Stir up waters to catch fish.' -- Robert Greene (39th law of power)*

> *'Play a sucker to catch a sucker - seem dumber than your mark.' -- Robert Greene (21st law of power)*

HOWEVER, deceiving is not lying.

> *'Lying is like a nuclear bomb. The effects will be there for a long time to you to deal with.'*

> *'One of the most potent weapons in the battle for information is giving out false information.'*

> *'Don't lie to anybody that you are not going to kill. Lying is a bad idea. The lie is going to burn you.' -- hostage negotiator*

> *'I'm not upset that you lied to me. I'm upset that from now on I can't believe on you.' -- Nietzsche*

<!-- 
> *'Disappointment destroys trust.'*

> *'Bad liars should speak as little as possible.'*
-->



===
###On mirroring

Mirroring works best when your group is in minority.

> *'Being pacifist in face of wolves is the source of endless tragedy.'*

> *'To change a status quo based on a minority, the majority must unite. To do that use non-violent organized action and humor, keeping the risk as low as possible so everybody can join your side.' -- Srdja Popovic*

> *'Disarm and infuriate with the mirror effect.' -- Robert Greene (44th law of power)*



===
###On charming

<!--
charming and selling?
-->

Charm the enemy and find their weaknesses.

> *'Instead of killing, charm the snake (once there are always more snakes) to fight the other ones. Listen actively and maintain rapport. Know your audience. First they have to [trust](#on-trust) you. Keep your word and prove your worth, the new guy as always to prove himself.'*

> *'Pose as a friend, work as a spy.' -- Robert Greene (14th law of power)*

> *'Discover each man’s thumbscrew.' -- Robert Greene (33rd law of power)*

> *'Use selective honesty and generosity to disarm your victim.' -- Robert Greene (12th law of power)*

> *'Work on the hearts and minds of others.' -- Robert Greene (43rd law of power)*

> *'People's need for validation and recognition, their need to feel important, is the best kind of weakness to exploit.'*

Use absence and bait to attract people.

> *'In the long run, the ability to make others come to you is a weapon far more powerful than any tool of aggression.'*

> *'Learn to keep people dependent on you.' -- Robert Greene (11th law of power)*

> *'Make other people come to you: use bait if necessary.' -- Robert Greene (8th law of power)*

> *'Bait people into going out on a limb, exposing their weaknesses, then rake them with fire from the side.'*

> *'We attract more flies with honey than vinegar.'*

> *'Stay aloof and people will come to you. It will become a challenge for them to win your affections.'*

> *'Use absence to increase respect and honor.' -- Robert Greene (16th law of power)*

HOWEVER, use absence with [moderation](#on-balance).

> *'Quem muito se ausenta um dia deixa de fazer falta.'*



===
###On easy targets

Beware of easy targets. Most times it's [bait](#on-charming).

> *'Despise the free lunch.' -- Robert Greene (40th law of power)*

> *'Sometimes one pays most for the things one gets for nothing.' -- Albert Einstein*

> *«El dorados» are never drawn in the map.'*

HOWEVER, there are same people acting stupid though. Easy wins if you can identify them.

> *'Don't attribute to malice what you can attribute to incompetence or busyness.'*

> *'In the course of your life you will be continually encountering fools. There are simply too many to avoid.'*

> *'Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the the universe.' -- Albert Einstein*



===
###On difficult targets

To win, besides outworking them, you'll need all weaponry. Even the 'dirty stuff'.

> *'Put all the meat in the barbecue.' -- Portuguese soccer coach*

*Pawn sacrifices* are an example of 'dirty stuff'.<br>
They can be effective but use them *only* on life changing situations: it's a scar for life.

> *'Get others to do the work for you, but always take the credit.' -- Robert Greene (7th law of power)*

> *'Keep your hands clean.' -- Robert Greene (26th law of power)*

<!-- bribes, lying -->

When nothing else works, [surrender](#on-surrendering). Only use anger and go [all in](#on-desperate-targets) if you can see the end already.



===
###On desperate targets

Desperate targets will risk anything in a fight. This gives them a huge advantage, they have nothing to lose.

> *'Beware the fury of a patient man.' -- John Dryden*

> *'Use anger only as a tool, when you need it to improve your situation.'*

> *'Beware of sad people.'*

<!--
 *'Our fearlessness shall be our secret weapon.' -- John Green*

###On finishing

Finish it. [Going halfway](#on-focus) is too expensive to do it often.

> *'Crush your enemy totally.' -- Robert Greene (15th law of power)*

> *'Only put off until tomorrow what you are willing to die having left undone.' -- Pablo Picasso*

> *'When the end finally comes, it comes quickly.'*

> *'Ultimately the only peace and security you can hope for from your enemies is their disappearance.'*

> *'Reconciliation is out of the question. Only one side can win, and it must win totally.'*



===
###On winning

It's not just about winning. The way you win sets you up for the next round.

> *'All endings are also beginnings. We just don’t know it at the time.' --  Mitch Albom*

> *'The destination is not the end of the road; it's just a stop along the way. An intersection to take you to your next destination.'*



===
###On surrendering

Use this opportunity to re-create yourself.<br>
'It only hurts when you don't have time to prepare for the fall' -- Tony Hawk

> *'Surrender conceals great power: lulling the enemy into complacency, it give you time to recoup, time to undermine, time for revenge.'*

> *'Use the surrender tactic: transform weakness into power.' -- Robert Greene (22nd law of power)*

> *'Re-create yourself.' -- Robert Greene (25th law of power)*

###On time and attention

Time itself, is not your limitation. It's attention.<br>
You’re not managing time, you're managing attention.

> *'Do things in batch all at once. Interruption and switching between tasks costs too much.' -- Allen Tucker*

> *'Paying bills automatically means you won’t be late and you free up your mental energy to focus on other things.' -- Allen Tucker*

Track time and journal for hints on where to improve.

> *'Track your time manually so you have to see it and deal with it. Use a spreadsheet or paper.' -- Allen Tucker*



===
###On past and memory

You are your memory but *let go* your past [failures](#on-mistakes-and-failure).<br>
They are meant to guide you, not to define you.

> *'He'd wasted most of his life thinking he'd wasted most of his life'*

> *'People forget more future events than past events.'*

> *'I don’t know any longer whether I’m living or remembering.' -- Albert Camus*

> *'You can't start the next chapter of your life if you keep re-reading the last one.'*

> *'Never regret something that once made you smile.'*

> *'Half of the game is learning how to forget events in the past that eat away at you and cloud your reason.'*

> *'Stop looking for happiness in the same place where you lost it.'*

<!-- 
> *'Repetition is good for memory but its a thin line between repetition and getting annoyed.'* 

people remember more the beginning and the end of something

people forget by decaying and giving them other stuff for them to remember.

Embracing the medium simply ensures that everybody else knows it. aka let go
-->



===
###On present

You will die soon. Act accordingly and don't postpone joy.

> *'Every day in the mirror I watch death at work.' -- Jean Cocteau*

###On intelligence and talent

> *'In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts; they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty.' -- Ralph Waldo Emerson*

> *'Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent. It takes a touch of genius, and a lot of courage, to move in the opposite direction.'*

> *'I think we have an ideology about talent that says that talent is a tangible, resilient, hardened, shiny thing. It will always rise to the top. To find and encourage talent, all you have to do as a society, is to make sure the right doors are open. Free campus visits, free tuition, letters to the kids with high score. You raise your hand and say, «over here!» and the talent will come running, but that's not true. It’s not resilient and shiny, talent is really, really fragile. -- Malcolm Gladwell'*

HOWEVER, intelligence and talent are the most sensitive trigger points for envy.

> *'To reveal the true nature of your intelligence rarely pays; you should get in the habit of downplaying it at all times.'*

===
###On fame

See fame as a multiplier. If you want to impact the world, be famous.

> *'Do everything in public. Other people are facing the same problems. They not only will identify with you, they can provide solutions.'<br>
'Do things worthy of making you famous. The audience you build allows you to multiply everything you do across all those people. It increases your impact. It makes it easy to sell something. It makes it easy to come up with products and services. They will ask you or you can ask them.' -- Allen Tucker*



===
###On luck

When you’re not winning, life will seem hideously unfair to you.<br>
But be positive, luck is a pattern and the pendulum will swing back your way eventually.

> *'«Random» usually means that you haven’t looked long enough to see a pattern emerge.'*

###On investment

Spend less, a lot less, than you make. Stay liquid. Never invest in anything you can’t sell in 30 days.

> *'The safest way to double your money is to fold it over once and put it in your pocket.' -- Kin Hubbard*

> *'Never lose money. Rule No. 2: don’t forget rule No. 1.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'When forced to choose, I will not trade even a night’s sleep for the chance of extra profits.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'The best companies aren't sold, they're bought.'*

> *'Wherever oil goes, the stock market goes.'*



===
###On economics and politics

> *'Morality is the way that we would like the world to be, whereas economics is the way that the world actually works.' -- Steven Levitt*

> *'Science is a wonderful thing if one does not have to earn one's living at it.'*

> *'The whole of science is nothing more than a refinement of everyday thinking.'*

> *'The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and all science.' -- Albert Einstein*

> *'And on the first day, men created god.'*



===
###On art and aesthetics

'Good taste is easy. What is challenging, is to be close to vulgarity.' -- Adam Caruso<br>
That's where «big bucks» are.

> *'Most people with good taste are young and poor.'*

> *'Poets are damned but see with the eyes of angels.' -- Allen Ginsberg*

> *'Art is just another form of screaming.'*

> *'Sharpness is a bourgeois concept.' -- Henri Cartier-Bresson*

> *'Artistic death is made by consensus.'*

> *'Life is Capitalism but art is Socialism.'*
