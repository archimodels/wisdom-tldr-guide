###On analysis

Analysis is more an art than a science.

> *'To find deep truths intuition is better than statistics.'*

> *'«Dictator's dilemma»:  when the vote goes 79% – 21% for some candidate we presume it was fair and represents a popular mandate. But when his excellency and Great Father of his People, gets 97% of the vote we say that is BS.'*

And, as such, error-prone: bias, being [misled](#on-deceiving) and randomness will trigger miscalculations.

-->

> *'May your choices reflect your choices, not your [fears](#on-fear-and-excuses).' -- Nelson Mandela*

> *'I am not a product of my circumstances. I am a product of my decisions.' -- Stephen Cove*

> *'You have choices. Choices are experiments.'*

> *'Decisions are made based on memory. There are 3 routes: reflex (genetics), habits or goals. So influence their memories and you can influence their decisions'*

<!-- Do i need to justify my choice? What am i searching for? functional decision vs emotional decision.

too familiar - too unfamiliar. we like what is in the middle! similar enough and different enough to be liked. the secret is on the [middle](#on-balance) -->

<!-- Do i need to justify my choice? What am i searching for? functional decision vs emotional decision.
too familiar - too unfamiliar. we like what is in the middle! similar enough and different enough to be liked. the secret is on the [middle](#on-balance)
Always assume that you’re wrong from a purely philosophical point of view. We arealways wrong about whatever we believe. Knowledge is always moving forward, and if you think about things you used to believe 10 years ago or five years ago, it embarrasses you now. And the things that you hold dear and hold to be true today are likely going to embarrass you in 10 or 20 years from now.  -->



===
###On planning

Plan ahead, make the decisions right now. When in the moment of making the decision, you have already done it.

<!-- > *'Moments of originality and moments of conformity.'*

> *'Teach no one your tricks or they will be used against you.'* 

ignorance is a bliss, gives you freedom to think about stuff. being ignorant about the market and the “right way” to do things allows them to come up with creative solutions to problems that experienced veterans would never have thought of. Do not see your ignorance as a curse, see it as a blessing.
-->

> *'Good ideas are a numbers game. You need a lot of bad ones to get one good.'*

> *'Ideas by themselves are roughly worthless. There's no market for them. There's no place where one can go and buy an idea. Describing your idea in detail doesn't mean other people will copy it. First they'll have to be convinced it's a good idea. If you ever tried to change anyone else's mind you know by now how hard that is. Not even founders themselves can predict how well their own ideas will do. And even if people are convinced your idea is a good idea, they'll still have to compare it to the existing idea they are already working on and see which one they're more likely to do well with.'*



===
###On neutrality and isolation

Neutrality is not possible. Anyway preserve your [freedom](#on-freedom).

<!-- Don't avoid conflict. Small conflicts will grow into big conflicts.

> *'Go and do the things you can’t. That is how you get to do them.' -- Pablo Picasso*

> *'I cannot give you the formula for success, but I can give you the formula for failure, which is: try to please everybody.' -- Herbert Swope*

> *'I want to know God's thoughts; the rest are details.' -- Albert Einstein*

> *'Strike the shepherd and the sheep will scatter.' -- Robert Greene (42nd law of power)*

> *'The ability to ignore immediate dangers and pleasures translates into power.'*

Sometimes you need to say YES to everything and be open to growth;<br>

Life is a balancing act.

You can have all the money in the world, but if your home life and health are out of order, you will suffer.
Conversely, you can have a loving family and a shredded body, but if you are not making enough money, you and your loved ones will suffer.
Balance is not about spending the same amount of time focused on every area of your life either.
It is about making progress in all areas of your life and ensuring that you improve just a little bit each day in your health, wealth, relationships, and personal growth. -->

===
###On charming

###On difficult targets

To win, besides outworking them, you'll need all weaponry. Even the 'dirty stuff'.

> *'Keep your hands clean.' -- Robert Greene (26th law of power)*

<!-- bribes, lying -->

When nothing else works, [surrender](#on-surrendering). Only use anger and go [all in](#on-desperate-targets) if you can see the end already.

###On leadership

Being a leader is different from being a boss. Leadership is based on [trust](#on-trust-and-integrity).

> *'A leader is best when people barely know he exists, when his work is done, his aim fulfilled, they will say: we did it ourselves.' -- Lao Tzu*

> *'The secret to motivating people and maintaining their morale is to get them to think less about themselves and more about the group.'*

> *'If you want to lead, simply act with confidence and others around you will pick up on that energy and fall in line. No explicit statements needed. If someone fails to fall in line, either your leadership needs improvement or you need to excise them from your group.'*

> *'Be royal in your own fashion: act like a king to be treated like one.' -- Robert Greene (34th law of power)*

> *'People don't follow robots.'*

> *'There are no bad teams, only bad leaders.'*

People want leadership because they want autonomy and influence.

> *'The person who clears the path ultimately controls its direction, just as the canvas shapes the painting.' -- Ryan Holiday*

> *'Influence is more powerful than money. The reason millionaires are depressed is that they don’t know the difference.'*

CHALLENGE:

> *'Keep your attempts at intimidation under control. Be careful not to become intoxicated by the power fear brings.'*

<!-- mix com persuasion -->



===
###On communication

Management is about communication.<br>
Being a leader requires to be equal parts manager and psychotherapist.

> *'Instead of generalizing and saying «management is useless», it's more correct to say «bad management is counterproductive».'*

> *'Spend 1 hour a day just talking to your people and everything will be OK.'*

> *'The goal is to move everyone up from «unconfident and incompetent» to «confident and competent». Some people also go through «incompetent and confident», «where the best option is often to stand back and act as a safety net while letting the person learn whatever lesson they needed to learn.' -- exelius*

> *'Start a meeting with an overachieving question: «how can we raise sales by 12%?»'*

Don't add your two cents, specially on subjective stuff, unless you're certain the delivered work is not good enough.<br>
If feedback is needed, give a reason.

> *'Try «can you take another look at this for XYZ reasons?». This gives the employee ownership of the final deliverable, while still prompting them to deal with problems they overlooked.'*

> *'«Because» is a great motivator.'*

And ask instead of telling.

> *'«Why did you decide to do X in that order?». This creates a dialog, instead of a debate where each side first stakes out positions. Lead your people to discover what you would have suggested. Smart people will get to the same place you were going, or you may learn something, if you are humble enough to listen.'*

> *'Make pertinent questions as: <br>
«Is that the best you can do?» <br>
«Interesting, how do you feel about it?» <br>
«What does your team think?»'*

In any case, [humility](#on-identity) is needed for leadership. Pounding directives down or not giving any direction are demotivators for your junior people. Gaining an understanding and giving appropriate feedback makes your juniors feel like what they are doing is important.



===
###On delegation

Managing is delegating. Your speed as a manager is the speed of the team.<br>

> *'A manager should make himself 2 questions a day: <br>
«What is important to accomplish?» (where are you going) <br>
«Where was I uncomfortable the day before?» (what went right and where do you need support) <br>
The speed that you offload your stuff will be the speed of your team.'*

> *'If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.' -- African proverb*

> *'Your productivity as a manager is measured as the productivity of your team. Being seated making stuff is not productive.
The key principle is putting your team’s productivity first. Remember, you are a communication hub and a multiplier. Think about the things you can delegate vs. the things that only you can do. If you truly work for your people instead of hiding at your desk, just tell yourself: what I accomplished today is not yet visible, but it will be.'*

Productivity is different from workflow engineering.

> *'Don’t postpone to tomorrow what other people can do for you today.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'Be productive, not cheap. Stop dicking around trying to figure stuff out that someone else already knows.'*

> *'Start as close to the end as possible.' -- Kurt Vonnegu*

<!-- And use deep work

> *'Too busy pretending I'm occupied.'* -->



===
###On hiring

Hire anyone but only retain the best.

> *'He who works with his hands is a laborer.<br>
He who works with his hands and his head is a craftsman.<br>
He who works with his hands and his head and his heart is an artist.' --  St. Francis of Assisi*

> *'2 valid methods: hiring on culture contribution and hiring on culture matching.'*

> *'Trust someone if they say they are human and susceptible to conflicts of interest but actively avoiding such conflicts.'*

> *'Always look for internal spies, people in the enemy camp who are dissatisfied and have an ax to grind.'*

CHALLENGE:

> *'Be wary of people who want to collaborate - they are often trying to find someone who will do the heavy lifting for them.'*

> *'Honesty is a very expensive gift, don't expect it from cheap people.' -- Warren Buffett*



===
###On being hired

Employers hire you because you are a likable person that «get shit done».

> *'When applying for a job be more of a consultant than an applicant.'*

> *'Bad professionals make money off their customers, good professionals make money for their customers.' -- Jacques Mattheij*

> *'Your work is the single greatest means at your disposal for expressing your social intelligence.'*

CHALLENGE: companies don't care about you. Having a job is risky, avoid the trap of following one set career path.

> *'I work for money, if you want loyalty hire a dog.'*

> *'If your job doesn't require originality, next decade you might not have one.'*

> *'The moment you [rigidly follow a plan](#on-adapting) set in your youth, you lock yourself into a position, and the times will ruthlessly pass you by.'*

> *'The interesting jobs are the ones that you make up.' -- Chris Young*



===
###On negotiation

To negotiate is to have options. <br>
Negotiate while advancing. The more you take, the more you can give back in meaningless concessions.

> *'Control the options: get others to play with the cards you deal.' -- Robert Greene (31st law of power)*

> *'When people feel they have a choice, they walk into your trap that much more easily.'*

> *'When asking for help, appeal to people’s self-interest, never to their mercy or gratitude.' -- Robert Greene (13th law of power)*

Never negotiate with binary questions: 

> *'«What can you do?» instead of «Will you do this?»'*

Best way to say no:

> *'«How am I supposed to do that?». «How» gives people an opportunity to show how smart they are.'*

Tone of voice is a big clue to know with whom we are negotiating:

> *'The analytical cold guy is very patient; <br>
The assertive guy (eg. Trump) wants to make it fast; <br>
For the accomodator, the relationship is the most important'*

<!-- > *'Unexpressed feelings never die.'*
> *'Releasing pressure is different from venting.'*
> *'The more influence somebody is the more they use we / plural pronouns.'*
> *'There are so many wingman breaking communication. looking for cliches, profanity, adjectives, emotions, whats important for them, body language.'*
> *'Listening for things that you didn't see. for incongruence.'*
> *'They will hurt, and than say what you have to say. people then are expecting and it doesn't hurt as much.'*
naming the negatives first.'* -->

> *'On negotiation you don't need to match the other person mood, you should be playful and smart, taking the other to mirror your good mood also.'*

> *'mirroring and reword. repeating the last one to three words of the other person. it opens up people's brain. Its' very effective.'*test the firmness of what they want. the others had to think about it. people didn't even realize it.'*

<!-- > *'Instead of generalizing, stick with the facts.'* -->

CHALLENGE: always strive to achieve a win-win situation. The deal will fall if both sides don't take what they need from it.

> *'Peace cannot be kept by force. It can only be achieved by understanding.'*

> *'You can’t make a good deal with a bad person.'*

They are meant to guide you, not to define you.

> *'He'd wasted most of his life thinking he'd wasted most of his life'*

> *'People forget more future events than past events.'*

> *'I don’t know any longer whether I’m living or remembering.' -- Albert Camus*

> *'You can't start the next chapter of your life if you keep re-reading the last one.'*

> *'Never regret something that once made you smile.'*

> *'Half of the game is learning how to forget events in the past that eat away at you and cloud your reason.'*

> *'Stop looking for happiness in the same place where you lost it.'*

###On luck

When you’re not winning, life will seem hideously unfair to you.<br>
But luck is a pattern, the pendulum will swing back your way eventually.

> *'Even a broken clock is right twice a day.'*

> *'There’s no magic in the world. It’s all math.' -- discrete math professor*

===

That said, a bad/good negotiation means that you are adding more/less value to the world than receiving money for it.
