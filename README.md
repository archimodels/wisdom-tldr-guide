###On identity

You are your deeds.

> *'How you do anything is how you do everything.'*

> *'Weakness of attitude becomes weakness of character.'*

Choose to be your best self. You need to come alive.<br>
Succeeding at mediocrity isn't a worthwhile life.

> *'Waking up to who you are requires letting go of who you imagine yourself to be.' -- Alan Watts*

> *'Don’t ask yourself what the world needs, ask yourself what makes you come alive and go do that. Because what the world needs is more people to come alive.' -- Howard Thurman*

<a id="on-trust"></a>Choose to keep your integrity.<br>
It's the only way to be respected and build trust.

> *'Seek respect, not attention. It lasts longer.'*

<!--
Life is About Who You Become Not What You Achieve
On this journey called life, many people lose sight of what is really important.
They believe that material wealth, sexual experiences, and physical prowess are what makes a man.
But the reality is, life is about the man that you become, not the things that you do or the possessions that you gather.
It’s about your character.
It’s about who you impact, the way you show up in the world, and the way that you treat those around you.

integrity is what you think is what you say, and the same what you do.
being vulnerable is taking don't be afraid of taking a risk.

Generosity without Expectation is Sexy
It means that your thoughts, words, and actions are all in congruence.
you don’t live a life that is incongruent with what you want to make others happy.
You live a life of congruence where everything is in line.
This is the pathway to true power.

1 - i approve of me.
2 - i am my word.
5 - i keep my word / i take nothing she says seriously, helps me relax.

Part of being a man is being a protector.protector of everyone who comes into your life.
Part of Being a Man is Getting Shit Done
As an occasional treat, video games or TV are not inherently bad, but we live in a society where most men waste 3+ hours a day in a virtual world when they should be getting shit done.

Background values will change how you think

do you want short term popularity or long term respect

5Cs: courage, congruence, confidence, calibration, conviction
-->

HOWEVER, live in accordance with your nature. If something is forced it will not be sustainable.

> *'If you try to be something you're not, you end up being nothing.'*

> *'Focus more on what you’re naturally good at. If something is holding you back, recognize it and fix it, but you don’t have to be great at everything. You weren’t made to spend 10 hours a day staring at a screen in a cubicle arguing over email. If you do this your body will fall apart. As your body falls apart so will your brain. As your brain goes so does your chances of success or happiness.' -- Allen Tucker*

<!--
find your context. you don't need to suceed in every context
-->

<a id="on-humbleness"></a>And remember to be humble, you are not perfect neither you'll ever be.

> *'A way to humble yourself is to put you in the position of being the weakest person in something during the day.'*

> *'Everyone you will ever meet knows something you don't.' -- Bill Nye*



===
###On freedom

Choose *yourself*. Choose to be independent.<br>
Tell *your* truth no matter what.

> *'Do not commit to anyone.' -- Robert Greene (20th law of power)*

> *'That’s the problem with putting others first: you’ve taught them you come second.'*

> *'Choose a life you want and then create the things you need around it. A girl, a job, a friend, all of those should help you achieve the life you want. If it doesn’t, get rid of it.'*

> *'There comes a time when you ought to start doing what you want. Take a job that you love. You will jump out of bed in the morning. I think you are out of your mind if you keep taking jobs that you don't like because you think it will look good on your resume.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.' -- Ralph Waldo Emerson*

> *'You have only so much energy and so much time. Every moment wasted on the affairs of others subtracts from your strength.'*

> *'At the core of every man is the desire to be free yet ironically men often confine themselves to a cage.'*

<!--
The freedom to express oneself fully.

set boundaries
Practice doing without things you think you need.

3. You Have to Make the Definite Decision to Succeed
The only thing separating you from your wildest dreams and ambitions is that you have not yet made the definite decision to achieve them.

You Need to Stand Up for Yourself
Never be afraid to stand up for yourself, your friends, or your values, because at the end of the day it is better to live a short life where you face your fears
-->

> *'A man is free at the instant he wants to be.' -- Voltaire*

> *'Freedom is not free. It is earned. It is taken. It is wrestled from the jaws of fear and uncertainty and doubt.' -- Dan Kariv*

> *'Freedom is more precious than any gifts for which you may be tempted to give it up.'*

> *'My independence is my legacy.' -- Bagão Felix*



===
###On gratefulness and happiness

'Happiness is not a goal, it is a byproduct.' -- Eleanor Roosevelt

> *'Happy life = mastery + belonging + autonomy.'*

> *'We have the idea that comfort brings happiness. Happiness comes from not having fear.'*

> *'We derive our true sense of fulfillment from constantly pursuing a life of «uncomfortability».'*

Meanwhile, while you create the life of your dreams, lower your expectations and love the life you have.

<!--
seek happiness actively (action) and passively (lower expectations)

happiness is inside you, not with another person.
-->

> *'Happiness = reality / expectations'*

> *'Need to jump start happiness? Lower your expectations.' -- James Altucher*

> *'Manage with bread and butter until God sends the honey.' -- Moroccan proverb*

> *'If you concentrate on what you don’t have, you will never, ever have enough.' -- Oprah Winfrey*

> *'A pessimist sees a difficulty in every opportunity. An optimist sees an opportunity in every difficulty.'*

> *'While optimists will sometimes mistake a steaming turd for pure gold, they will not miss a piece of genuine gold when it crosses their path.'*

By breaking long term goals you can enjoy the journey.<br>
Happiness is a journey, not a destination.

> *'The minute you're satisfied with where you are, you aren't there anymore.' -- Tony Gwynn*

<!--
anchor yourself - remember who you are, the things you are good at, even when completely different thing

###On finding a path

Cancel your pity party. No one is coming to save you.<br>
Pull yourself together and take total ownership for everything in your life.

> *'If you are feeling lost in life, you need to experience more things.'*

> *'What do you do for fun? What are you interested in that everybody in the world is interested in?'*

> *'Take some time away from all external influences and really decide what you want for yourself in the areas of health, wealth, relationships, and personal growth. Then, do it.'*

> *'Let your fear be your guide. The more fear you feel, the more you will know you are on the right track.'*

<!--
Figure out what you want out of life and figure out how much money you will need to make it happen, then start taking the steps necessary to get there.

search for actionable steps\

When you look at your bank account and don’t like what you see, you need to remember that these results were caused by your thoughts. They were caused by your beliefs, your decisions, and your values that were then projected into your reality.

– Have a Mission
Every day, whether it’s “be creative today.” Or “go some place you’ve never been” or “talk to ten random strangers”, make a mission.
Learn something new.
Missions are for people who DO. Mission statements are for people who DON’T.

What do you really want?
- What do the actions of your past suggest is most important to you?
- What desires do you have that don't align with your past behavior.
- What future path does your past behavior suggest rather than your imagination?
- If you don't like these answers, change your existing behavior.
Spend more time doing the things you really want to do.
Getting very clear about what is important allows you to stop caring so much about things that are unimportant.

What does it mean to be you? Who are you?

“It seems so easy because you hang out with yourself all day,” she said. “But it’s so easy to get distracted by who you feel you should be… or who you wish you were. Or who other people expect you to be.”
it’s OK to stop doing things that should make you feel good, but don’t.

Step 1: Do less of what you don’t like doing -- unless it is limiting you
Step 2: Do more of what you like doing
Step 3: Use envy
“Envy is painful, but it’s a very helpful emotion for a happy life. It’s a giant red arrow sign standing over someone’s head saying, ‘They've got something you want.’”

> *'It’s hard to beat a person who never gives up.' -- Babe Ruth*

> *'Work until your idols become your rivals.'*

> *'Work hard in silence. Let your silence be your noise.'*

> *'How much time do you consume vs produce? Are you watching others do things you could be doing if you weren’t watching them.' -- Allen Tucker*

HOWEVER, don't be thirsty: the [journey](#on-gratefulness-and-happiness) will not be enjoyable and people will [envy](#on-outliers) you.

If You Are Not Growing You Are Dying
Life is about constant and never-ending growth.
If you want to live your life in such a way that you can take your final breath with a smile on your face, then you must be willing to commit yourself to constant growth.F!ck complacency.
I don’t care if you have $10,000,000 in the bank account, a model wife, and all the material possessions this world has to offer, if you are not pushing yourself to grow and expand, you are digging yourself an early grave.
Never settle in life, never be content with who you are and what you have achieved.
You have to constantly push yourself to do more, achieve more, and, most importantly become more.

Most 16 year olds are just using their phones to send silly snaps to their friends and watch porn.
And most people waste their lives away in 9-5 jobs. It's not an age thing.

“We must suffer one of two pains, either the pain of discipline or the pain of regret and disappointment.”

lying in death bed and regretting your life is the worst that can happen to you.

> *'I miss being the age when i thought I would have my shit together by the time I was the age I am now.'*

###On comfort and risk

You need to break rules to achieve anything great.<br>
Breaking rules [frightens](#on-fear-and-excuses) people but comfort is the enemy of achievement.

> *'If we play by the rules too strictly, if we take them too literally, we are crushed by those around us who are not so foolish.'*

> *'If you think adventure is dangerous, try routine. It's lethal.' -- Paulo Coelho*

> *'Normality is a paved road: It’s comfortable to walk, but no flowers grow on it.' -- Van Gogh*

> *'There is pleasure in the pathless woods.' -- Lord Byron*

> *'A ship is safe in the harbor but that's not what ships are for.'*

> *'Think of yourself as an explorer. You cannot find anything new if you are unwilling to leave the shore.'*

> *'You can choose courage or you can choose comfort, but you can't choose both.'*

> *'Take risk. Big audacious risk. You’ll never get what you want in life without it.'*

> *'Choose the hard way. Life is easy, and a soft life makes for soft people. Take a cold shower, join a boxing gym, use the stairs instead of the escalator, go out in nature alone for a week.'*

<!--
Risk Leads to Growth and Excitement

Risk looks different for everyone.

2.Suffering is a Temporary But Essential Part of Life

So adventure is more than just grist for future storytelling — it’s a way to learn optimally. And like anything that promotes self-improvement, it’s not always a comfortable process. “We need to be willing to grow,” says Jon. “We need to be willing to be uncomfortable.”

You will live a life that is filled with more excitement and fulfillment the more you take intentional risks.

> *'But how can you live and have no story to tell?' -- Fyodor Dostoyevsky*

“The size of our life is in direct proportion to how uncomfortable we are willing to be”

1. To Improve Your Life, You First First Become Uncomfortable
If you want to improve the quality of your life, then start by improving your tolerance for risk and adversity.
Because almost everything that you want is on the other side of the uncomfortable and the scary.

Adventure Comes from Percieved Risk, Not Peril
develop a tolerance for risk so that you can build up to the scarier activities later.

###On habits and systems

Habits allow [mastery](#on-mastery) and [success](#on-success).<br>
Consistency doesn’t come from effort, it comes from systems. Decisions compound.

> *'We are what we repeatedly do, excellence therefore is not an act, but an habit.' -- Aristotle*

> *'52 approaches in a year is more than most men make in a lifetime. Consistency is everything.'*

> *'Volume usually outpaces intensity. You can’t just put in a huge effort a few times.' -- Allen Tucker*

Create high value systems: [meditate](#on-meditation), spend time outside, [rest](#on-health), travel, learn useful skills.<br>
Avoid low value systems: social media, news, owning a TV, working long hours, control of petty stuff, perfectionism..

> *'Go for a walk in the morning and decide what would make the day a successful day.' -- Allen Tucker*

> *'Use social media as an output not as entertainment. Your phone should not be the first thing you see in the morning nor the last thing you see at night.' -- Allen Tucker*

> *'It makes other people’s stories more interesting when you don’t know what’s going on outside your world. The news causes completely unnecessary stress and it’s negatively biased.' -- Allen Tucker*

<!--
mental checklist of positive habits.

> *'The pathway to freedom is discipline.'*

People who are driven by the fear of missing out or the dream of early adopter super stardom are deploying a “middlebrow inference” that examines only the maximum possible return, not the value derived in expectation.
The opportunity cost of missing a ‘new new thing’ like the airplane and the automobile is minuscule compared to the toxicity of all the garbage one has to go through to get these jewels.”
it’s the rejection of such thinking that has led me to continue to abstain from Facebook and Twitter, among other popular pastimes in the rapidly evolving digital attention casino.

Use your phone to set reminders for really important things automatically. Turn off push notifications for everything else.

Focus on Showing Up not Achieving Goals 

1) Invest in long-term wellbeing
a. Physical health:
b. One new thing: learn at least one new thing everyday. Read, watch a documentary, look around, observe, engage in a conversation.
c. Be creative: Creativity conquers jealousy, envy, self-pity. It conquers worry. 
d. Gratitude

don't focus in productivity.

###On improving

Most problems can be solved by graded exposure over time.

> *'To improve is to change; to be perfect is to change often.' -- Winston Churchill*

> *'Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.' -- Gandhi*

<!--
Only applied knowledge is power, and if you have spent years devoting your time and energy to learning without taking the proper proportion of action, then it is time to get off your ass, leave the theory on your nightstand, and get in the game

Just in time learning. You can learn faster if you have something your working on rather than some future idea that may not happen. Improves retention, wastes less time.

“We must suffer one of two pains, either the pain of discipline or the pain of regret and disappointment.”
there are consequences for acting and don't acting

4. Education not Schooling is What Separates the Winners from the Losers

You improve by:<br>

> *'Tell me and I’ll forget; show me and I may remember; involve me and I’ll understand.' -- Chinese proverb*

> *'Welcome the attacks of your enemies for how much they improve your work and toughen you up.'*

> *'Practice makes perfect but doesn't make new. New comes from having a broader perspective.'*

> *'People repeat very easily the same mistakes. You improve by examining them.'*

> *'You can only connect the dots looking back, not looking forward.'*

> *'All truly great thoughts are conceived by walking.' -- Nietzsche*

HOWEVER, action not knowledge leads to [success](#on-success).

> *'As much as possible, try to apply your knowledge in some form of experiment or practice. If not is educational porn.'*

> *'«Pathological learners» who are voracious consumers of knowledge. They live in a 400 square foot apartment, are overweight, and in a relationship that looks like something out of a bad soap opera. Yet they know all this information! The problem is that they do not apply it. You have to realize that knowledge without action is useless.'*

2. To Lead a Balanced and Healthy Life You Need to Ask the Right Questions
Tony Robbins says that the quality of your life is based on the quality of the questions that you ask yourself.
If you are facing health struggles, you need to ask yourself these three questions to truly uncover the root cause of the issues in your life.
1) What Are You Holding On To?What happened in your life that you are still angry, depressed, or frustrated with? What are you really holding onto that is holding you back.
2) What is Life trying to Teach You?How can you reframe the thing that you are holding onto into something good? What is life trying to teach you through that struggle.
3) How Can I Move On?What steps do you need to take to move on with your life? Who do you need to forgive, what needs to be said, who needs to be removed from your life?

Write advice to yourself or other people. Review it regularly. Edit it. Refine it. It worked for Marcus Aurelius and it worked for Bruce Lee.
I’ve started a list of advice or things I know. Perhaps things I believe I know. Some of these are lessons I’ve learned the hard way, others are lessons I’ve observed in others. This process reminds us of what’s most important and helps us to avoid making the same mistakes in the future. I will edit and add to this over time. Try making your own list and I think it will be worth your time.
-->



===
###On feedback

Feedback speeds up improvement.<br>
Mentors are your best source of feedback. Only take advice from them.

> *'Build your Board of Directors. Mentors and friends who are achieving on a higher level than you who are willing to call you out on your failures and lift you up for your successes. Once you build this infrastructure of support and accountability, your life will radically transform.'*

> *'Find somebody smarter to teach you, somebody equal to challenge you and somebody less developed that you can teach'*

> *'I’d rather have criticism from a genius than praise from an idiot.'*

> *'Follow the thought leaders instead of the traffic leaders.'*

> *'Find mentors to help you improve, even virtual mentors as a good book.'*

> *'A coach spots your bullshit before you open your mouth.'*

> *'Your father is your first mentor.'*

<!--
Surround yourself with people who challenge you to be better, not people who are enamored with who you already are.
-->



===
###On achieving mastery

After learning the rules, break them. Only then you can achieve mastery.<br>
But the path to mastery is a never ending story: skills are perishable.

<!--
effort * talent = skill

trade-able skills: figure out what skills you already have that you can charge for
-->

> *'A real Dj has to know how to clear the floor. To know the worse it can happen and how to come back' -- James Altucher*

> *'An expert is someone who knows some of the worst mistakes that can be made in his subject, and how to avoid them.' -- Werner Heisenberg*

> *'Masters are able to ask the kinds of simple questions that most people pass over.'*

> *'The master has failed more times than the beginner has ever tried.' -- Stephen McCraine*

> *'The very desire to find shortcuts makes you eminently unsuited for any kind of mastery.'*

> *'The master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house.' -- Audre Lorde*

> *'You want to learn every aspect of that subject, you are expected to be a pro. There is no place for a prima donna.'*

> *'If you aren’t growing you’re dying.' -- Tony Robbins*

<!--
> *'We have knowledge of a thing only when we have grasped its cause.' -- Aristotle*
-->

HOWEVER, mastery is the main trigger of [arrogance](#on-arrogance). There's always room for improvement: be [humble](#on-humbleness).

> *'I am not young enough to know everything.' -- Oscar Wilde*

> *'How often our early triumphs turn us into a kind of caricature of ourselves.'*

> *'If you gain any kind of attention or success for your work, you face the great danger of creeping conservatism.'*



===
###On generosity and mentorship

Be generous and share your strengths. Impact the world.

> *'One repays a teacher badly if one remains only a pupil.' -- Nietzsche*

> *'Powerful people give freely, buying influence rather than things.'*

> *'A society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit in.' -- Greek proverb*

> *'If you think you're too small to make an impact, try to go to bed with a mosquito in the room.'*

> *'The best way to cheer yourself up is to try to cheer someone else up.' -- Mark Twain*

> *'Play on people’s need to believe to create a cult-like following.' -- Robert Greene (27th law of power)*

<!--

karma

Be generous from a place of abundance, where you are giving because you are already so full, not from a place of scarcity where you are kind because you want something in return.

You cannot give what you do not have, and the first step to truly serving others is to serve yourself.
Take time for yourself, allow yourself to recharge and recuperate, invest into your growth and education.
Then, and only then, will you be fully equipped and able to serve others to your fullest capacity.

###On success

There is no shortcut to the top. Success is a castle that you build [brick by brick](#on-habits).<br>
Success is not being [wealthy](#on-wealth) but being [happy](#on-gratefulness-and-happiness).

> *'Success is peace of mind which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you did your best to become the best you are capable of becoming.' -- John Woode*

> *'Success is simple, but it is not easy. Success is nothing but the accumulation of small things done consistently over a long period of time.'*

> *'Success doesn’t come to you. You go to it.' -- Marva Collins*

HOWEVER, [doubt](#on-confidence-and-validation), not failure, is the biggest barrier to success.

> *'The greatest barrier to success is the fear of failure.' -- Sven Goran Eriksson*

> *'Doubt kills more dreams than failure ever will.'*

<!--
1. Success is in Our Decisions Not Our Conclusions
Many people think that success is about the attainment of something, but the truth is, success is about who you become along the way and the decisions that you make.
Success is truly about living a life with honor and integrity, not any material outcome.

success is not the accumulation of stuff

If you want to succeed at anything in your life, then forget about the Joneses.
You don’t need the fancy car, expensive watch, or flashy toys, spend your money on experiences, on your family, and on living a lifestyle that makes you happy. Don’t spend it on getting into a meaningless competition with shallow and materialistic people.

True fulfillment comes from living your life, not from achievement.

Success is Internal not External: If you want to achieve true fulfillment, then realize that happiness is internal.

If you want to succeed at anything in your life, then forget about the Joneses.
You don’t need the fancy car, expensive watch, or flashy toys, spend your money on experiences, on your family, and on living a lifestyle that makes you happy. Don’t spend it on getting into a meaningless competition with shallow and materialistic people

Experiences worth more than material

“The things we do that get us to feel the true, deep sense of accomplishment are things like running a marathon, climbing a mountain, writing a book, and inventing something,”

###On stress and health

Take care of your body. It’s the most important thing you’ll get for free.<br>
HOWEVER, the origin of most health problems is not physical but mental.

> *'There are links between mental health and physical health. Physical stress avoids need for control.'*

> *'Body language affects your psychology, your mood, and even your hormonal balance.'*

> *'Action cures everything. Plain and simple.'*

Stress is caused by under-stimulation or over-stimulation (worrying about the [past](#on-past) or the [future](#on-future)).<br>
The more relaxed you are, the better you are at everything.

> *'Under-stimulation (boredom) / right amount of stress (hustling = stretching comfort zone) / over-stimulation (anxiety)'*

<!--
- The cure for worry? Presence (as recently discussed with Amy Cuddy, author of Presence: Bringing Your Boldest Self to Your Biggest Challenges). Focus on the task at hand. Face forward, but don’t live in the pretend future where the thing you’re fearing wins.

> *'If you are depressed you are living in the past. <br>
If you are anxious you are living in the future. <br>
If you are at peace you are living in the present.' -- Lao Tzu*

<!-- ligar com #on-control -->

> *'Anxiety is linked with our wired out evolutionarily for a [need of control](#on-control). Anxiety is not planning, anxiety is to go on continuously over any kind of scenario. Past is only in your head. What's important is present and future. We don't control anything, at most we influence some stuff.'*

> *'Anxiety and depression are symptoms, not diseases.'*

> *'Worry is a misuse of the imagination.'*

> *'Stress is caused by giving a fuck.'*

> *'Financial health is just as important as physical health. Nothing feels as good as having a «fuck you» fund.'*

> *'If you are feeling stressed out.. breathe.'*

> *'If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it; and this you have the power to revoke at any moment.'*

> *'Memories need sleep to get consolidated. Sleep deprivation is bad for memory. Stress also.'*

> *'I've decided to be happy because it is good to my health.'*

<!-- 
You can’t perform under pain, stress, etc. without adequate capacity. That capacity is physical.

You mind is a made of physical things. Neurons, chemicals, electricity. Your physical state, capacity for physical stress, sleep, diet, experiences, determine the bulk of your mental state. Do not rely upon cognition to make change. Behavior and the physical world are your key to changing affect and cognition. Your mental performance IS physical performance.

> *'Balance on body training = flexibility (yoga or animal movements) + strength (weights)'*

> *'If I had to prescribe two things to improve health and happiness in the world, it’s movement and play.' -- Jason Nemer*

When most people are struggling with pain, they fail to realize that often times, their pain is caused by a mental or emotional problem and not a physical problem. This could stem from a childhood trauma, a tragic event, or simply a personal insecurity.
Reframe Your Pain and Become Grateful 
The simple truth is, it is hard to be in pain when you are in a state of gratitude and love. 5. Release the Pain. Be grateful for how it helped you become the man you are, but accept that you no longer need it in your life and let it go.

If you feel powerless/being dominated you will be chronically stressed.

Your limits are where are your fears.

> *'Your beliefs determine your reality. Nothing can sabotage you more quickly and more completely than limiting beliefs.'*

> *'The only person standing in your way is you.' -- Black Swan*

HOWEVER, your level of success will seldom exceed your level of personal development.

###On fear, anger and excuses

Fear is paralyzing. To overcome it, replace fear of unknown with curiosity.

> *'If you view everything through the lens of fear, then you tend to stay in retreat mode.'*

> *'Behaviors are driven by fear. to change behaviors focus on fear, not on the behavior itself.'*

> *'Don’t be afraid to be alone. Don’t be afraid to be committed. Fear is the most limiting quality a person has.' -- Michelangelo*

> *'You always have two choices: your commitment versus your fear.' -- Sammy Davis Jr.*

> *'The things we fear the most have already happened to us.'*

> *'You'll never have fear of loss when you give more value to lessons than successes.'*

> *'Expose yourself to your deepest fear; after that, fear has no power, and the fear of freedom shrinks and vanishes. You are free. -- Jim Morrison*

Anger and excuses are fear clothed. All excuses are refutable.

> *'You can’t be grateful and angry simultaneously.' -- Tony Robbins*

> *'There is no coming to consciousness without pain.<br>
People will do anything, no matter how absurd, in order to avoid facing their own Soul.'*

> *'You cannot use your personality type as an excuse.'*

> *'You'll never be as young as you are today.'*

<!--
Be careful not to let fear paralyze you either.
Realize that on the other side of every fear is a stronger, more powerful, and more grounded man. Embrace the fear and achieve your dream life.

> *'It’s not the mountain we conquer but ourselves.' -- Sir Edmund Hillary*

###On mistakes and failure

Fail fast and bounce back quickly by being [grateful](#on-gratefulness-and-happiness):<br>
Sometimes you win, sometimes you learn. Accept failure as part of the process.

> *'Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new.'*

> *'The greatest mistake you can make in life is to continually be afraid you will make one.' -- Elbert Hubbard*

> *'A scar is not an injury. A scar is an healing. After an injury, a scar is what makes you whole.' -- China Mieville*

> *'Repeated failure will toughen your spirit and show you with absolute clarity how things must be done.'*

> *'You are more than your mistakes. Your past mistakes are meant to guide you, not to define you.'*

> *'Making mistakes is better than faking perfections.'*

> *'Be gentle first with yourself.'*

> *'The more you fail, the more you learn.'*

> *'When you don't know something you will pay for it. That's the stupidity tax.'*

> *'Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.' -- 1 Thessalonians 5:21*

<!--
failures are flip-sides of our strengths
the opposite is true also

###On shame

Speaking openly about an imperfection is a sign of strength, not a weakness.<br>
You are not you think you are: *you are what you hide*.

<!--
You can hide the ugly parts, but you can't make them disappear.
-->

> *'Imperfections are attractive when their owners are happy with them.' -- Augusten Burroughs*

> *'Comfort in our failures allows us to act without fear, to engage without judgment, to love without conditions.'*

> *'Once you’ve accepted your flaws, no one can use them against you.' -- Tyrion*

> *'It takes more courage to reveal your insecurities than to hide them.' -- Alex Karras*

> *'Being entirely honest with oneself is an important exercise.' -- Sigmund Freud*

> *'What you fear you attract; what you resist, you make it bigger.'*

> *'Just get out of the room.' -- Robert Glover*

> *'Shame corrodes the very part of us that believes we are capable of change.' -- Brene Brown*

> *'Nobody feels love when they feel shame.' -- John Townsend*



===
###On confidence and validation

If you say it with confidence, you are who you say you are.

> *'You're only as good as your next speech.'*

> *'A speech is a performance. Authenticity is crucial.'*

> *'Believe you can, and you’re half way there.'*

Don’t wait for someone to tell you that you are special. If the universe didn't need you, you wouldn't be here.

> *'You should look at rejection as a tool that reveals incompatibility instead of evidence of your unworthiness or inadequateness.'*

> *'Having a low opinion of yourself is not modesty. It’s self-destruction.' -- Bobby Sommer*

> *'Value yourself. The only people who appreciate a doormat are people with dirty shoes.' -- Leo Buscaglia*

> *'Let go of your ego and your need for validation.'*

[Mastery](#on-mastery) and [core values](#on-identity) are good sources of confidence.<br>
In the meanwhile any source is good. Don't stop till you get it.

> *'If you don't believe in yourself. Believe in me who believes in you.'*

> *'Fake it till you make it.'*

<a id="on-arrogance"></a>HOWEVER, know the frontier between confidence and arrogance.

> *'Confidence is not walking into a room thinking you are better than everyone, it's walking in not having to compare yourself with anyone at all.'*

> *'Ego is the enemy. People say that you can't fly and then you flew. Then you think you are God.'*

<!-- 
> *'Presence is confidence without arrogance, grounded enthusiasm and comfortable behavior. Authenticity can't be faked.'*

Confidence is a result, not a requirement
-->

> *'Controlling the impression that you make on others takes a large amount of cognitive bandwidth and everything will appear as fake.'*

> *'Arrogance is a smokescreen for insecurity.' -- Amy Cuddy*

###On networking

Don't isolate yourself. The people you know and whether they like you will determine what opportunities you get.

<!--

building a network is critical

3) Find out what people actually want

if people forget it wasn't a good network anyway

A person starts to live when he can live outside himself. Be in the moment instead of being in your head.

network --
raw connections
community of experts (that give you good answers)
critical colleagues (10 people that make a big difference in your immediate career) - boss / boss's boss

ask advice to a person that you know, everybody says that you're the best to explain that. people will like you more

build rapport - cut the BS. speak whats in your mind, sometimes it backfires. be real

i didn't get your text can you resend it? less strong. will you write a whole book in your phone? make it non threating

> *'on networking: expand from too dense networks. custom tailor teams from project to project. same team from same project is not the best option. if anybody in your list knows everybody is a big pro

###On communication

Speak less and listen more: be [humble](#on-humbleness). Listening is powerful.

> *'Listen to many, speak to a few.' -- William Shakespeare*

> *'People don’t listen, they just wait for their turn to talk.' -- Chuck Palahniuk*

> *'Listen to predict a collapse.'*

> *'Arguing as you're right. Listening as you're wrong.'*

> *'You can never be sure who you are dealing with. A man who is of little importance and means today can be a person of power tomorrow.'*

> *'Judge a man by his questions, not by his answers.'*

Learn how to talk to people: smile, don't ramble, look for external catalysts as hints for stories and questions, talk about your passions instead of your accomplishments, never be stubborn and listen.

> *'Rambling and not smiling are two things to get better speaking to anybody.'*

> *'Get better asking questions. They are more important than answers.'*

> *'Talk about your passions instead of your accomplishments (aka bragging), transform it in a story.'*

> *'Storytelling is about the details.'*

> *'On improvisation is more productive to say «yes and» instead of «yes but». Get rid of ego and add value. Don't judge.'*

> *'Know how to lead a conversation and how to go with the conversational flow. Get out of your head and become more situationally aware, always looking for external catalysts.'*

> *'You don't always have to get the last word. Make your point and leave it that way. Let go.'*

It’s a common belief that your first reaction is the most honest, but I disagree. Your first reaction is usually outdated.

###On business and entrepreneurship

Business exchanges value for money.<br>
Focus on areas where you are motivated to add value AND there's demand.

> *'What you need to start a new business: generosity.' -- Derek Sivers*

> *'Focus on what can you give instead of focusing in making money. Find your market and you'll get the reward.'*

> *'Money is energy.'*

> *'Money is the expression of your creativity.'*

> *'To make money focus on the fun.'*

> *'Scratch your own itch it's good only as a start.'*

> *'In some complex and mature markets if you start too small you will never be able to compete with existent players. «Starting up in a garage» works mostly on new and undeveloped markets.'*

Validate your business by finding paying clients.

> *'Without customers, you don’t have a business. You have a hobby.' -- Don Peppers & Martha Rogers*

> *'The consumer votes with his wallet.'*

> *'Test sales first. If something is worth doing, sales will come easy and dollars will be high. If you have to drag people along kicking and screaming, you’re wasting your time. If they were in, they'd be in on day one.'*

> *'Do things manually at first. You don’t have to build an elaborate system to get started. Get one client and do everything the hard way. Only after business is over running your ability to do things manually you do have to worry about automation. Don’t put a bunch of effort in on the front end to find out there’s no demand.'*

> *'In general, it's not about what you know, it's about who trusts you to solve their problems.<br>
Often, that requires the technical skills to reliably solve their problems.<br>
Always, that requires the communication skills to persuade someone you can solve their problems.'*

Successful *entrepreneurs* are good risk managers.

> *'Be cautious. Entrepreneurs normally take a big risk and offset it with cautious moves (e.g. day job). Entrepreneurs are more risk averse than general population.'*

> *'Entrepreneurs prepare for bad. They budget pessimistically using the worst case scenario.'*

> *'When evaluating an idea make sure the math scales. E.g. If you’re looking for a restaurant location, look at how many seats, average price of meal, average turnover time, multiply it out. Will even max capacity pay the rent? How many potential sales, how much does it cost to reach them, what is a conversion rate to expect? How much can you produce in an hour, will that ever pay you enough?'*

> *'Startup fortune cookie: that company that seems so interested in buying you won't.'*

4. Focus on Revenue Generating Activities

One of the simplest habits that you can start implementing today is to shift all of your focus towards revenue generating activities.
Plain and simple, if it is not going to earn you money, then don’t do it. Focus only on the activities that are going to push the envelope forward for you and your company and result in an influx of cash.
If there are tasks that need to be done that do not directly result in the generation of revenue, then outsource them so that you have more time to work on building your cash flow

there's not a lot competition neither a lot of people looking for change. our biggest competitor is indifference and inaction. people are already solving their problems, better or worse. very few people are always researching for something better.

as long as we’re not on the good side, we say ‘what the hell?’ because we don’t enjoy the middle ground. The middle ground is not helping us define who we are. Rather than trying to fix a problem that we see as mostly broken, it’s common for us to hope for a clean slate or a reset button of some kind. This is why mechanisms like Catholic confession are so powerful.

You only have to be really right once.
- Mark Zuckerberg thought that facebook was going to be a college directory and that was it.
- Bill Gates didn’t think the Internet had any potential. Seriously.
- History is filled with examples of people like this. They were right about one thing one time and made so much money that it allows them to be consistently wrong over and over again in big ways because their underlying model was right the first time. They had the resources to correct any mistakes and to try a lot of other things, most of which will fail.
If you only have to be right once, your goal must be to allow yourself many opportunities to be wrong and still keep going.

###On selling

We're all in sales. You're in sales anytime you interact with anybody.

Sales used to be about information asymmetry but times are changing.<br>
Now it's mostly [applied persuasion](#on-charming) and keeping relationships.

> *'Historically, the seller had more information than the buyer.<br>
Its a different game now. Everybody knows immediately the alternatives.'*

> *'Selling by just keeping in touch. Send emails once in a while.'*

> *'To sell is to deal with objections.'*

> *'When you go up in an hierarchy, the need of persuasion is higher.<br>
To persuade up, focus in interests; to persuade down focus in emotions.'*

> *'Best sellers are ambiverts.'*

<!--
irritation -> challenge people to make something that they don't want to do
agitation -> challenge people to make something that they want to do. suggesting ego etc

agitate more than irritate

mimicking people gestures and words works!

So can you pitch me what our company does?

people minds work by association.
pre-suasion

use testimonials that allow people to see themselves in that testimony
people are intrigued by mystery! stories!

get to objections

when you have passion you communicate better

intro: //clay hebert
I help (or a derivative) investors (target: people is too generalist but don't over tailor it) to build better things (skill. use intrigue and confidence)
6 or 7 words - short and sweet and confident and interesting.

ask them first so you can costumise it for the context and make it more relevant.

then give an interesting story: choose one testimonial
instead of detail and inaccurate.

success in sales
ocean of rejection. face your failures is a good indicator of being a good seller.
most rejections are not your fault.

I use to go into job interviews with a story in mind. All an interviewer really wants to know is if he can spend eight hours a day around you

###On negotiation and price

To negotiate is to have options.<br>
Negotiate while advancing. The more you take, the more you can give back in meaningless concessions.

> *'Control the options: get others to play with the cards you deal.' -- Robert Greene (31st law of power)*

> *'When people feel they have a choice, they walk into your trap that much more easily.'*

> *'When asking for help, appeal to people’s self-interest, never to their mercy or gratitude.' -- Robert Greene (13th law of power)*

Never negotiate with binary questions: 

> *'«What can you do?» instead of «Will you do this?»'*

Best way to say no:

> *'«How am I supposed to do that?». «How» gives people an opportunity to show how smart they are.'*

Tone of voice is a big clue to know with whom we are negotiating:

> *'The analytical cold guy is very patient; <br>
The assertive guy (eg. Trump) wants to make it fast; <br>
For the accomodator, the relationship is the most important'*

<!-- 
> *'Unexpressed feelings never die.'*
> *'Releasing pressure is different from venting.'*
> *'The more influence somebody is the more they use we / plural pronouns.'*
> *'There are so many wingman breaking communication. looking for cliches, profanity, adjectives, emotions, whats important for them, body language.'*
> *'Listening for things that you didn't see. for incongruence.'*
> *'They will hurt, and than say what you have to say. people then are expecting and it doesn't hurt as much.'*
naming the negatives first.'* 

REMeMBER PEOPLE THAT THEY HAVE CHOICES, That they can control.

you don’t get what you deserve in life, you only get what you negotiate.

never split the difference

Negotiate contracts in minute detail on the front end so that you aren’t negotiating after work is done, investments are made, and you have no bargaining power. This is especially important if the relationship between people is important as it avoids conflict later on.

> *'On negotiation you don't need to match the other person mood, you should be playful and smart, taking the other to mirror your good mood also.'*

> *'mirroring and reword. repeating the last one to three words of the other person. it opens up people's brain. Its' very effective.'*test the firmness of what they want. the others had to think about it. people didn't even realize it.'*

Negotiation establishes the price (exchange rate between money and value).
That said, a bad/good negotiation means that you are adding more/less value to the world than receiving money for it

> *'Pay too much for everything. The effort spent getting a deal is only a distraction and attention is your most limited resource.' -- Allen Tucker*

HOWEVER, always strive to achieve a win-win situation. The deal will fall if both sides don't take what they need from it.

###On relationships

Relationships are based on mutual [trust](#on-trust).

> *'A great relationship is about finding the similarities and respect the differences.'*

> *'Focus on what you can give not what you can get. You only receive in proportion to what you give.'*

<!--
first we judge trust, before strength.
we build trust through presence. leadership is based on trust.

> *'If a person is nice to you and to nobody else, that person is not nice.'*

on a deep relationship, politics must match
-->

HOWEVER, after taking the first step [mirror](#on-mirroring) their behavior. Run away from mediocrity and be ready to loose people.

> *'Don't hide your feelings from people who show you theirs.'*

> *'Forget those who forget you. Those who want to stay in your life, will always find a way.'*

> *'If you are lonely when you are not alone, you are in bad company.'*

> *'Humans make connections. Sometimes these connections grow. Sometimes they stay the same. Sometimes they collapse.'*

> *'The free soul is rare, but you know it when you see it - basically because you feel good, very good, when you are near or with them.' -- Charles Bukowski*

> *'You loose your identity, you loose people.' -- Amy Cuddy*

> *'Don't let people that are bad influences to put you down.'*



===
###On lovers

Never love anyone that treats you like you're ordinary.

> *'Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength, while loving someone deeply gives you courage.' -- Lao Tzu*

> *'Every person feels loved in a different form.'*

> *'Love doesn’t hurt. Expectations do.'*

> *'On a serious conversation with a SO, instead of generalizing, talk about three things:<br>
First, your observations, or what you have noticed is happening in your relationship.<br>
Next talk about how the observation has made you feel. Finally, discuss your values.'*

HINT: keep separate bank accounts.

> *'Spouses should have the freedom and autonomy to buy what they want, but only after bills are automatically paid. People value things differently. Having to justify every expense makes you feel like you’re being watched. This breeds resentment. Most marriages end in divorce, most of them over money.'* 

HOWEVER

> *'Love me when I least deserve it, because that's when I really need it.' -- Swedish proverb*

<!--
If you are struggling in your relationships, odds are, you are withholding your truth from your woman.
You need to open up, tell her the truth, be honest with her without fear of outcome and without any neediness from her.R

> *'Men experience many passions in a lifetime. One passion drives away the one before it.' -- Paul Newman*
-->



===
###On family and friends

You will waste your life trying to make those around into who you want them to be.<br>
Instead change/filter who you are around. You are the average of the people you surround yourself.

> *'Cleave from your family but then come back. You need to be independent and loyal at the same time.'*

> *'Your friends are the ones that go to your funeral AND in a day of rain.'*

> *'Infection: avoid the unhappy and unlucky.' -- Robert Greene (10th law of power)*

> *'If you're the smartest in the room, you're in the wrong room.'*

> *'Working with friends is not good, because there will be always problems of fixing hierarchy. Peers are peers, not boss and employee.'*

<!--
You need to build your board of directors. Life is meant to be lived in community.

But keep your friends for friendship, work with the skilled and competent.

> *'Get proximity to successful, happy, and rich people. Be cool. They will likely influence you automatically.'*

you're never a prophet in your homeland.

> *'Work friends are just that, work friends. Nothing more.'*

> *'Never put too much trust in friends, learn how to use enemies.' -- Robert Greene (2nd law of power)*

Seek out mentors and friends who are achieving on a higher level than you who are willing to call you out on your failures and lift you up for your successes. Once you build this infrastructure of support and accountability, your life will radically transform.

###On rewards

Be an expert gift giver.

> *'Negative reinforcement isn’t as effective as positive reinforcement - even for people. Punishment only works near the situation that did that to you.'*

> *'Always be generous: a low value gift can have the opposite effect.'*

> *'Always give best in class: practical luxuries make better gifts than merchandise branded with your company’s logo.'*

###On conflicts

Don't avoid *relevant* conflicts. Small conflicts will grow into big conflicts.<br>
Neutrality is not possible. Anyway preserve your [freedom](#on-freedom).

> *'Avoiding conflict will not keep peace, will rot it.<br>
Rotten peace builds resentment.'*

> *'I am either part of the solution or part of the problem.'*

> *'Well-kept gardens die by pacifism.'*

###On criticism and envy

Outliers inspire envy. [Intelligence](#on-intelligence), [wealth](#on-wealth), [ambition](#on-ambition-and-motivation), [fame](#on-fame), [luck](#on-luck), [beauty](#on-beauty) and a mix of them ([lifestyle](#on-lifestyle)) are the main triggers. 

> *'Great spirits have always found violent opposition from mediocrities. The latter cannot understand it when a man does not thoughtlessly submit to hereditary prejudices but honestly and courageously uses his intelligence.' -- Albert Einstein*

> *'They called her witch because she knew how to heal herself.'*

> *'Never appear too perfect.' -- Robert Greene (46th law of power)*

> *'Have exactly one vice. Two is too much. None makes you boring. Drink cocktails. Beer is for uncreative people.'*

You’re judged by what you say, not what you think.

> *'Think as you like but behave like others.' -- Robert Greene (38th law of power)*

> *'If A is a success in life, then A = X + Y + Z. Work is X; Y is play; and Z is keeping your mouth shut.' -- Albert Einstein*

When people criticize your life they are speaking about their fears and limitations not yours.<br>
So ignore and be flattered by these people, whether they are bosses, life-long friends, or even family members.

Only take advice from [those who are achieving what you want to achieve](#on-feedback), and ignore the rest.

> *'Never hate people who are jealous of you, but respect their jealousy. They think that you're better than them.'*

> *'Don’t argue your path with other people. Walk it.' -- Lazy Yogi*

> *'The dogs bark but the caravan moves on.' -- Arab proverb*

> *'Consensus happens just in the beginning and in the end of something.'*

HOWEVER, beware of blindspots, not all criticism is envy.

> *'When somebody says something bad about you, is negativity. When everyone says it, is advice.'*

> *'If too many users are wrong, it's probably your fault.'*

> *'The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing.'*

> *'Let me never fall into the vulgar mistake of dreaming that I am persecuted whenever I am contradicted.' -- Ralph Waldo Emerson*



===
###On following the herd

Most people are other people. Their thoughts are someone else opinions and they jump to conclusions.

> *'Common sense is the collection of prejudices acquired by age eighteen.'*

> *'People accept the defaults very easily.'*

> *'Gold rushes make the shovel sellers rich, not the gold seekers.'*

> *'Nothing is more terrible than to see ignorance in action.' -- Goethe*

> *'The whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, and wiser people so full of doubts. '-- Bertrand Russell*

> *'And those who were seen dancing were thought to be insane by those who could not hear the music.' -- Friedrich Nietzsche*

HOWEVER, smart people don’t think others are stupid and common sense is not so common.

> *'Taking a fence down without knowing why is there.'*

> *'There are no smart people or stupid people, just people being smart or being stupid. Being smart means thinking things through - trying to find the real answer, not the first answer. Being stupid means avoiding thinking by jumping to conclusions. Jumping to a conclusion is like quitting a game: you lose by default.That’s why saying «I don’t know» is usually smart, because it’s refusing to jump to a conclusion. So when someone says «They are so stupid!» - it means they’ve stopped thinking.'*

###On leadership

Being a leader is different from being a boss. Leadership is based on mutual [trust](#on-trust).

> *'A leader is best when people barely know he exists, when his work is done, his aim fulfilled, they will say: we did it ourselves.' -- Lao Tzu*

> *'The secret to motivating people and maintaining their morale is to get them to think less about themselves and more about the group.'*

> *'If you want to lead, simply act with confidence and others around you will pick up on that energy and fall in line. No explicit statements needed. If someone fails to fall in line, either your leadership needs improvement or you need to excise them from your group.'*

> *'Be royal in your own fashion: act like a king to be treated like one.' -- Robert Greene (34th law of power)*

> *'The only thing that gives orders, is balls.' -- Tony Montana*

> *'People don't follow robots.'*

> *'There are no bad teams, only bad leaders.'*

> *'No one is smarter than a small group.'*

People want leadership because they want autonomy and influence.

> *'The person who clears the path ultimately controls its direction, just as the canvas shapes the painting.' -- Ryan Holiday*

> *'Influence is more powerful than money. The reason millionaires are depressed is that they don’t know the difference.'*

HOWEVER,

> *'Keep your attempts at intimidation under control. Be careful not to become intoxicated by the power fear brings.'*

<!--
reduce you feelings of power to be more effective

boss ask employee to do x
employee resist, boss come back later after thinking about his resistance, maybe you can do something about

Refuse to work with people you don’t like.
Fire customers that cause you to much stress or that cost too much to service.
It takes a very small number of people (one) to ruin an environment. One person in the office is all it takes to make everyone miserable. Don’t tolerate these people. Take it as far as you need to take it. 

In order to be successful you will probably have to build a team of successful people to support you. You need them to be paid well and well taken care of. You must make it easy for them to succeed and you must teach them how to do it. You won’t do it alone. Put employees before customers. Owners make more than employees in the long run.

We advance the welfare of others — often unconsciously — by sharing resources, cooperating, and collaborating within a social structure. As perhaps an unintended consequence, we find ourselves gaining power. Most often, this power is something that’s given to us, and not something we set out to seize. This runs directly counter to the popular belief that power is attained by becoming a Machiavellian super villain and using force, manipulation, deception, and strategic ruthlessness to take it at the expense of others.
Individuals demonstrating value to other individuals — or companies demonstrating value to a society — gain power as a direct result.

When someone is out of line, don’t let it slide too far.
If you let someone treat your poorly for too long in order to avoid conflict, things will get so bad that you then have to have a huge fight in order to correct them. What could have been very small is now a real problem that may compromise your relationship, business, etc.

Always be clear and specific about what you expect from other people. You can not expect from them what you haven’t articulated…usually many times and in writing. Also plan for them to fail you.

a good leader: a) knows when to speak and when don't. b) knows to create a vision of where they wanna go.

###On management

Management is about communication.<br>
Being a leader requires to be equal parts manager and psychotherapist.

> *'Instead of generalizing and saying «management is useless», it's more correct to say «bad management is counterproductive».'*

> *'Spend 1 hour a day just talking to your people and everything will be OK.'*

> *'The goal is to move everyone up from «unconfident and incompetent» to «confident and competent». Some people also go through «incompetent and confident», «where the best option is often to stand back and act as a safety net while letting the person learn whatever lesson they needed to learn.' -- exelius*

HINT: don't add your two cents, specially on subjective stuff, unless you're certain the delivered work is not good enough.<br>
Ask instead of telling. If feedback is needed, give a reason.

> *'Try «can you take another look at this for XYZ reasons?». This gives the employee ownership of the final deliverable, while still prompting them to deal with problems they overlooked.'*

> *'«Because» is a great motivator.'*

> *'«Why did you decide to do X in that order?». This creates a dialog, instead of a debate where each side first stakes out positions. Lead your people to discover what you would have suggested. Smart people will get to the same place you were going, or you may learn something, if you are humble enough to listen.'*

> *'Make questions as: <br>
«Is that the best you can do?» <br>
«Interesting, how do you feel about it?» <br>
«What does your team think?»'*

> *'Start a meeting with an overachieving question: «how can we raise sales by 12%?»'*

HOWEVER, a leader needs [humility](#on-identity). Gaining an understanding and giving appropriate feedback makes your juniors feel like what they are doing is important. Pounding directives down or not giving any direction are demotivators.



===
###On delegation and productivity

Managing is delegating. Your speed as a manager is the speed of the team.<br>

> *'Don’t postpone to tomorrow what other people can do for you today.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.' -- African proverb*

> *'A manager should make himself 2 questions a day: <br>
«What is important to accomplish?» (where are you going)<br>
«Where was I uncomfortable the day before?» (what went right and where do you need support)<br>
The speed that you offload your stuff will be the speed of your team.'*

> *'Be productive, not cheap. Stop dicking around trying to figure stuff out that someone else already knows.'*

> *'Productivity is different from workflow engineering.'*

> *'Your productivity as a manager is measured as the productivity of your team. Being seated making stuff is not productive.
The key principle is putting your team’s productivity first. Remember, you are a communication hub and a multiplier. Think about the things you can delegate vs. the things that only you can do. If you truly work for your people instead of hiding at your desk, just tell yourself: what I accomplished today is not yet visible, but it will be.'*

<!--
> *'Too busy pretending I'm occupied.'*

===
###On hiring and keeping talent

Hire most but only retain the best.

> *'Trust someone if they say they are human and susceptible to conflicts of interest but actively avoiding such conflicts.'*

> *'2 valid methods: hiring on culture contribution and hiring on culture matching.'*

> *'Always look for internal spies, people in the enemy camp who are dissatisfied and have an ax to grind.'*

> *'He who works with his hands is a laborer.<br>
He who works with his hands and his head is a craftsman.<br>
He who works with his hands and his head and his heart is an artist.' --  St. Francis of Assisi*

How to keep talented people? Respect them.<br>
You'll never respect them if you don't pay them accordingly.

<!--
make them part of the solution and part of the answer.
you don't pay your family members, if its just money let them go.
everything has to be win win. team members and not employees
-->



===
###On being hired

Employers hire you because you are a likable person that «gets shit done».

> *'When applying for a job be more of a consultant than an applicant.'*

> *'Bad professionals make money off their customers, good professionals make money for their customers.' -- Jacques Mattheij*

> *'While deep work will promote you, shallow work will only prevent you from being fired.'<br>
'Career capital is the unique skills that make you rare and valuable'<br>
'Be so good that they cannot ignore you' -- Cal Newport*

> *'Is it better to be good at many things or great at one thing?<br>
To be an entrepreneur you need to know a little about a lot of things.<br>
To be employed, you'll do better as a specialist. If you pick the right specialization.'*

> *'Your work is the greatest mean at your disposal for expressing your social intelligence.'*

HOWEVER, having a job is risky: companies don't care about you.<br>
So avoid the trap of following one set career path. It will be easier to pivot when needed.

> *'I work for money, if you want loyalty hire a dog.'*

> *'The moment you [rigidly follow a plan](#on-adapting) set in your youth, you lock yourself into a position, and the times will ruthlessly pass you by.'*

> *'If your job doesn't require originality, next decade you might not have one.'*

> *'The interesting jobs are the ones that you make up.' -- Chris Young*

> *'We value “T-shaped” people. That is, people who are both generalists (highly skilled at a broad set of valuable things—the top of the T) and also experts (among the best in their field within a narrow discipline—the vertical leg of the T) (...) An expert who is too narrow has difficulty collaborating. A generalist who doesn’t go deep enough in a single area ends up on the margins, not really contributing as an individual. Where you choose to be deep should be an area of interest to you and which the market values.' -- Valve employee book*

'My luggage is always ready.'

> *'People pivot to near areas, combining two skills.'*

> *'Stack of skills -- Scott Adams

100% time -> 100% results<br>
20% time -> 80%results<br>
So: 100% on one thing = 80% on 5 things!<br>

> *'How to pivot:<br>
1) use the career fuel (transportable skills) that you have: soft skills (e.g. persuasive communication: pitching and change somebody's opinion, emotional intelligence, ability to read the room, ability to build trust, ability to retain talent) and hard skills.
write a pitch, are u persuasive, can you change somebody else opinion. making a 2 minute youtube, etc <br>
2) question: talent ledger: what are the people that were working for them. top leaders ask for help and give knowledge away. more open source.<br>
3) take risks to boost your immune system.'*

<!--
differentiate yourself / volunteer for an assignment
becoming the go to guy for some questions

> *'How to return to an workplace:<br>
- reframe your experience. Use today and future jargons. Make your homework.<br>
- refresh your skill set, if you got rusty.<br>
- career ecosystems, get back into them, reconnect.<br>
- reboot self confidence. Surround yourself with confident people.'

Hint from interviews: People will describe your strengths, if you ask them why did you ask him for an interview. Than work from there.

Happy, Smart, and Useful

A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly.

###On hierarchy

Only comedians can speak the truth without consequences.

> *'Never outshine the master.'<br>
'Know who you’re dealing with: do not offend the wrong person.'<br>
'Avoid stepping into a great man’s shoes.' -- Robert Greene (1st, 9th and 41st law of power)*

> *'Weak managers believe if an employee becomes irreplaceable, they have become expendable. Keeping employees dispensable is more important than keeping skilled talent. Read books written by managers for managers. Their actions aren't random or stupid.'*

> *'Higher the status, more exposure to parasites whose transmission isn't environmentally mediated.'*

> *'The highest form of the art of power is the ability to distinguish the wolves from the lambs, the foxes from hares, the hawks from vultures.'*

> *'Everything is hierarchy. Social cartography: who's the decision maker, to whom people are speaking and who is speaking.'*

HOWEVER, don't vow to the gatekeepers.

> *'Most people are basically afraid of their superiors. Someone’s position does not make them important. You can replace them as quickly as they can replace you. It's a business relationship.'*

> *'Only the truth is funny.' -- Rick Reynolds*

###On creativity, vision and ideas

Always be doing something creative. Without new experiences, your soul rots.

Finding a good idea: idea sex - mix stuff

> *'Good ideas are a numbers game. You need a lot of bad ones to get one good.'*

> *'We can’t solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them.'*

> *'The new is the forgotten because everything has already happened.' -- Arturo Pérez Reverte*

> *'We don’t have an «imagination» we have a memory.'*

> *'Those who do not want to imitate anything, produce nothing.' -- Salvador Dali*

> *'The secret to creativity is knowing how to hide your sources.' -- Albert Einstein*

> *'Good artists copy; great artists steal.' -- Steve Jobs & others*

> *'To invent, you need a good imagination and a pile of junk.' -- Thomas Edison*

> *'Creative minds are rarely tidy.'*

Judging ideas?

> *'Peers (fellow creators) are the best judging ideas. Managers are the worse because they are outcome attached (they will regret more a false positive than a false negative).'*

> *'Ideas by themselves are roughly worthless. There's no market for them. There's no place where one can go and buy an idea. Describing your idea in detail doesn't mean other people will copy it. First they'll have to be convinced it's a good idea. If you ever tried to change anyone else's mind you know by now how hard that is. Not even founders themselves can predict how well their own ideas will do. And even if people are convinced your idea is a good idea, they'll still have to compare it to the existing idea they are already working on and see which one they're more likely to do well with.'*

<!-- 
negative inspiration (things that don't work) - positive inspiration!

> *'Moments of originality and moments of conformity.'*

> *'Teach no one your tricks or they will be used against you.'* 

ignorance is a bliss, gives you freedom to think about stuff. being ignorant about the market and the «right way» to do things allows them to come up with creative solutions to problems that experienced veterans would never have thought of. Do not see your ignorance as a curse, see it as a blessing.

Creativity is a muscle - you have to practice it every day.
-->

Creativity is linked to autonomy.

> *'Creativity and critical thinking:<br>
In subordinate position it gets you labelled a dreamer, a weirdo, or an idiot.<br>
In executive position, visionary, maverick, multidisciplinary thinker, etc.<br>
You can only truly creative in a position with autonomy, so you either climb the ladder or start your own thing.'*

###On analysis

Analysis is an art, not a science.

> *'To find deep truths intuition is better than statistics.'*

> *'Statistics are like bikinis. What they reveal is suggestive, but what they conceal is vital.' -- Levenstein*

> *'«Dictator's dilemma»: when the vote goes 79% – 21% for some candidate we presume it was fair and represents a popular mandate. But when his excellency and Great Father of his People, gets 97% of the vote we say that is BS.'*

And, as such, error-prone: 

a) randomness;

> *'Most facts are a «tell» but some are just random.'*

c) [being deceived](#on-deceiveness);

> *'Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts.'*

> *'Never assume that what people say or do in a particular moment is a statement of their permanent desires.'*

b) and specially, bias, will trigger miscalculations.

> *'What Susie says of Sally says mores about Susie than of Sally.'*

> *'Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth.'*

> *'The hardest thing to explain is the glaringly evident that everyone has decided not to see.' -- Ayn Rand*

> *'An unfamiliar city is a fine thing. That’s the time and place when you can suppose that all of the people you meet are nice.' -- Louis Céline*

> *'Each generation imagines itself to be more intelligent than the one that went before it, and wiser than the one that comes after it.' -- Orwell*

Be specially careful when facing new ideas.<br>
Too much info is also prone to bias: you'll always find confirmation to your pre-existing beliefs.

> *'Nothing is as simple at seems at first, or as hopeless as it seems in the middle, or as finished as it seems in the end.'*

> *'I am both worse and better than you thought.' -- Sylvia Plath*

> *'You always get exaggerated notions of things you don’t know anything about.' -- Albert Camus*

HINTS:

> *'«Chekov bottle»: If something is described in a previous chapter, it means it will be important for the action in a future chapter.'*

> *'Pay attention to negative cues: what should have happened but did not.'*

> *'Look for something that doesn't make sense. That's where the gold mine is:<br>
«It doesn't make sense, the price is going down!». The world makes sense, just not the model. Some X factor is hidden.'<br>
'Don't try to make sense of the world. It's too complicated. Instead watch investors attempting to make sense of it. They're the ones that will make the assets price move.'<br>
'look for the obvious: «Do you want to be a writer? You should have something to say.»'<br>
'The most important question: «What do you need to see to change your view?»' -- Adam Robinson (adapted)*

###On planning and decision making

Plan ahead and prepare for the highly probable scenarios.<br>
Make the decisions right now. When in the moment of making the decision, you have already done it.

> *'Plan all the way to the end.' -- Robert Greene (29th law of power)*

> *'All battles are won or lost before they are ever fought.' -- Sun Tzu*

> *'The best way to predict the future is to invent it.' -- Alan Kay*

> *'If I had 9 hours to chop down a tree, I'd spend the first six sharpening my ax.' -- Abraham Lincoln*

> *'The script is going to be bad but in the end we'll finish eating pizza.'*

> *'I am not a product of my circumstances. I am a product of my decisions.' -- Stephen Cove*

> *'May your choices reflect your choices, not your fears.' -- Nelson Mandela*

> *'You have choices. Choices are experiments.'*

> *'Decisions are made based on memory. There are 3 routes: reflex (genetics), habits or goals. Influence their memories and you can influence their decisions.'*

Always assume that you’re wrong from a purely philosophical point of view. We are always wrong about whatever we believe. Knowledge is always moving forward, and if you think about things you used to believe 10 years ago or five years ago, it embarrasses you now. And the things that you hold dear and hold to be true today are likely going to embarrass you in 10 or 20 years from now. 

Say no to things you aren’t really excited about doing. Hell yes or no. The mediocre robs you of the great. sivers 

Make decisions about what you want to do ideally on the front end rather than tracking what you do on the back end. Planning a diet vs. recording a diet. Making decisions under stress vs making decisions when relaxed and clear headed.

we think we make choices but our choices are affected by others. (ex of naming a child)
people pick what is familiar. people are influenced without us realizing.
working class want to feel the same as others.
white collar want to feel different from others.

decisions are tainted by the emotional investments you accumulate, and the more you invest in something the harder it becomes to abandon it.

inoculate yourself from the stress of making hard decisions when you need to. -- Allen Tucker

Clarity is the Key to All Success: without a clear roadmap for who we are and what we want to achieve, we will never find true success.
You must know exactly what you want, when you want it, and why you want it.
Without this clarity, you will find yourself wandering aimlessly for years, or even decades of your life and looking back, wishing that you’d had more direction.

How to plan: start with a [vision](#on-creativity-vision-and-ideas).

> *'Vision is the art of seeing what is invisible to others.' -- Johnathan Swift*

> *'Someone’s sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'If you don’t know where you’re going, any road will get you there.' -- Lewis Carroll*

> *'Strategy requires thought; tactics require observation.' -- Max Euwe*

HINTS:

> *'Choose the plan with more options. The one that lets you change plan.'*

> *'Look for actionable steps.'*
 
HOWEVER, some people get paralyzed by [over thinking](#on-starting-and-timing).

> *'Don’t think too much, you’ll create a problem that wasn’t there in the first place.'*

> *'While we are reasoning concerning life, life is gone.' -- David Hume*

<!--
Decide in advance what your time is worth. Do not let others tell you how much you will be paid. They may make offers, but it is never their decision. It is yours.

###On starting, right time and procrastination

Just start.<br>
You cannot afford to wait for inspiration or opportunities, time is the most precious thing you own.<br>
Stop preparing and start doing. You can learn while you do it.

<!--
fear of starting, excuse

> *add mark manson on procrastination*
> *'Pressed by circumstances, we feel unusually energized and focused.'*

– Have a Mission
Every day, whether it’s “be creative today.” Or “go some place you’ve never been” or “talk to ten random strangers”, make a mission.
Learn something new.
Missions are for people who DO. Mission statements are for people who DON’T.

Direction is more important than pace.<br>
Don’t be afraid to take time away to find your direction.

###On focus and time management

Time itself, is not your limitation. Attention is.<br>
You’re not managing time, you're managing attention.

> *'Do things in batch all at once. Interruption and switching between tasks costs too much.'*

> *'Any media company harvest your attention and transform it into revenue.'*

> *'Busy imply out of control. lack of time is lack of priorities.'*

First the essential. Then the details.

> *'Concentrate your forces.'<br>
'Strike the shepherd and the sheep will scatter.' -- Robert Greene (23rd and 42nd law of power)*

> *'In a divided world, power will come from keeping your own group united and cohesive.'*

> *'Always look where you want to go, not where you don't want to go.'*

> *'Anything that does not bring me alive is too small for me.' -- David Whyte*

HINTS:

> *'Tackle your most important thing (MIT) first thing in the morning.'*

> *'Don't major on minor things.'*

> *'Focus. Do one thing really well. Solve one problem with one solution.<br>
Focus on the one thing most likely to get maximum results. Forget everything else.'*

HOWEVER,

4. Focus on Revenue Generating Activities
One of the simplest habits that you can start implementing today is to shift all of your focus towards revenue generating activities.
Plain and simple, if it is not going to earn you money, then don’t do it. Focus only on the activities that are going to push the envelope forward for you and your company and result in an influx of cash.
If there are tasks that need to be done that do not directly result in the generation of revenue, then outsource them so that you have more time to work on building your cash flow.

try to hit 10% of your followers instead of trying to hit all of them at the same time.

if you are the focus you will be assumed as being the the cause.

And too many decisions will drain you. Attention is the most limited resource.

> *'Reduce decision making on small tasks to a minimum and do it quickly and in bulk: what to wear, what to eat, etc.'*
-->



===
###On control

Control what you can. Ignore what you can't.

> *'You can lead a horse to water but you can’t make him drink.'*

> *'You can only control yourself. Control what you’re primed by, who you are around, the ideas and problems you focus on. Power comes from that. '*

> *'You want everything to stay the same until you’re ready for it to change. But you can’t do that. You can’t expect the whole world to stand still until you’re ready.' -- Gayle Friesen*

> *'Disdain things you cannot have: ignoring them is the best revenge.' -- Robert Greene (36th law of power)*

> *'If you change the way you look at things, the thing you look at change' -- Dr. Wayne Dyer*

HOWEVER,

> *'If things seem under control, you're just not going fast enough.' -- Mario Andretti*

> *'One’s real life is often the life that one does not lead.' -- Oscar Wilde*



===
###On balance

Life is a balancing act.

The dose makes the poison: things in excess become their opposite.<br>
The hardest skill is knowing when to stop.

> *'Do not go past the mark you aimed for; in victory, learn when to stop.' -- Robert Greene (47th law of power)*

> *'The hardest skill is knowing what could be simplified, and what's good enough.'*

> *'Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.'*

> *'If half of the room laughs and half doesn't is a success.'*

> *'A balance sheet must balance.'*

> *'Most things are not binary.'*

> *'Balance is not about spending the same amount of time focused on every area of your life either. It's about making progress in all areas of your life and ensuring that you improve just a little bit each day in your health, wealth, relationships, and personal growth.'*

Diversification solves a lot of problems.

> *'Don’t try to make your job your whole life. Don’t try to make your art your sole income.'*

How to balance an imbalance? Overcompensate.

> *'Overcompensate to make it balanced.' -- Derek Sivers*

> *'Some people get passion from something they struggled with.'*



===
###On adapting

Plans are not static. Adapt or die.<br>
You need to switch strategies a few times to get where you want to go.

> *'I am a man of fixed and unbending principles, the first of which is to be flexible at all times.' -- Everett Dirksen*

> *'Life is more like tetris than chess.'*

> *'One should not be too straightforward. Go & see the forest. The straight trees are cut down, the crooked ones are left standing.' -- Kautilya*

> *'The most important thing to do if you find yourself in a hole is to stop digging.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'What got you here won't get you there.'*

> *'The directions to get you anywhere include a few turns:<br>
Sometimes you need to say YES to everything and be open to growth;<br>
Sometimes you need to say NO to everything and focus.<br>
It's scary to make those direction choices, but that's how I know I'm on to something. Fear is a great road sign.'<br>
-- Derek Sivers (adapted)*

> *'However beautiful the strategy, you should occasionally look at the results.' -- Winston Churchill*

> *'Whatever space and time mean, place and occasion mean more.' -- Aldo van Eyck*

> *'If I don’t have red, I use blue.' -- Pablo Picasso*

HOWEVER

> *'Preach the need for change, but never reform too much at once.' -- Robert Greene (45th law of power)*

###On creating imbalances

Create imbalances in your target to create an advantage and raise chances of winning.<br>
Use methods like [unpredictability](#on-unpredictability), [deceiving](#on-deceiving), [mirroring](#on-mirroring)
and [bait](#on-charming). Some opponents may require special tools.

> *'Keeping your enemies on the defensive and in react mode will have a demoralizing effect on them.'*

> *'If you control the overall direction and framing of the battle, anything they do will play into your hands.'*

HOWEVER, beware of counter-attacking.

> *'The problems created by an audacious move can be disguised, even remedied, by more and greater audacity.'*

> *'Whenever you find yourself on the defensive and in trouble, the greatest danger is the impulse to overreact.'*

<!-- 
> *'Moving first—initiating the attack—will often put you at a disadvantage: you are exposing your strategy and limiting your options.'* 
-->



===
###On charming

Charm the enemy and find their weaknesses. Then [exploit them](#on-deceiving).

> *'Instead of killing, charm the snake (once there are always more snakes) to fight the other ones. Listen actively and maintain rapport. Know your audience. First they have to [trust](#on-trust) you. Keep your word and prove your worth, the new guy as always to prove himself.'*

> *'Use selective honesty and generosity to disarm your victim.'<br>
'Pose as a friend, work as a spy.'<br>
'Discover each man’s thumbscrew.'<br>
'Work on the hearts and minds of others.' -- Robert Greene (12th, 14th, 33rd and 43rd law of power)*

> *'People's need for validation and recognition, their need to feel important, is the best kind of weakness to exploit.'*

> *'If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his own language, that goes to his heart.' -- Nelson Mandela*

Use absence and bait to attract people.

> *'In the long run, the ability to make others come to you is a weapon far more powerful than any tool of aggression.'*

> *'Make other people come to you: use bait if necessary.'<br>
'Learn to keep people dependent on you.' -- Robert Greene (8th and 11th law of power)*

> *'Bait people into going out on a limb, exposing their weaknesses, then rake them with fire from the side.'*

> *'We attract more flies with honey than vinegar.'*

> *'Stay aloof and people will come to you. It will become a challenge for them to win your affections.'*

> *'Use absence to increase respect and honor.' -- Robert Greene (16th law of power)*

HOWEVER, use absence with [moderation](#on-balance).

> *'If you're always absent, soon you'll not be needed.'*



===
###On deceiving

'Appear weak when you are strong and strong when you are weak.' -- Sun Tzu

> *'Court attention at all cost.'<br>
'Play to people’s fantasies.'<br>
'Create compelling spectacles.'<br>
'Stir up waters to catch fish.' -- Robert Greene (6th, 32nd, 37th and 39th law of power)*

> *'Play a sucker to catch a sucker - seem dumber than your mark.' -- Robert Greene (21st law of power)*

> *'By seeming stronger than you are, perhaps through an occasional act that is reckless and bold, you can deter the enemy from attacking you.'*

HOWEVER, deceiving is not lying.

> *'Lying is like a nuclear bomb. The effects will be there for a long time to you to deal with.'*

> *'One of the most potent weapons in the battle for information is giving out false information.'*

> *'Don't lie to anybody that you are not going to kill. Lying is a bad idea. The lie is going to burn you.' -- hostage negotiator*

> *'I'm not upset that you lied to me. I'm upset that from now on I can't believe on you.' -- Nietzsche*

<!-- 
> *'Disappointment destroys trust.'*

> *'Honesty is a very expensive gift, don't expect it from cheap people.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'Bad liars should speak as little as possible.'*

===
###On unpredictability

> *'Conceal your intention.'<br>
'Say less than necessary.'<br>
'Keep others in suspended terror: cultivate an air of unpredictability.'<br>
'Assume formlessness.' -- Robert Greene (3rd, 4th, 17th and 48th law of power)*

HOWEVER, unpredictability can work against you: if you are in a subordinate position, it reduces trust.



===
###On mirroring

Mirroring works best when your group is in minority.

> *'Being pacifist in face of wolves is the source of endless tragedy.'*

> *'To change a status quo based on a minority, the majority must unite. To do that use non-violent organized action and humor, keeping the risk as low as possible so everybody can join your side.' -- Srdja Popovic*

> *'Disarm and infuriate with the mirror effect.' -- Robert Greene (44th law of power)*



===
###On opponents

1) Beware of easy opponents. Most times it's [bait](#on-charming).

> *'Despise the free lunch.' -- Robert Greene (40th law of power)*

> *'Sometimes one pays most for the things one gets for nothing.' -- Albert Einstein*

> *«El dorados» are never drawn in the map.'*

And desperate opponents will risk anything in a fight. This gives them a huge advantage, they have nothing to lose.

> *'Beware the fury of a patient man.' -- John Dryden*

> *'Use anger only as a tool, when you need it to improve your situation.'*

> *'Beware of sad people.'*

> *'Our fearlessness shall be our secret weapon.' -- John Green* 

HOWEVER, there are same people acting stupid. Easy wins if you can identify them.

> *'Don't attribute to malice what you can attribute to incompetence or busyness.'*

> *'In the course of your life you will be continually encountering fools. There are simply too many to avoid.'*

> *'Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the the universe.' -- Albert Einstein*

2) On difficult opponents, to win, besides outworking them, you'll need all weaponry.

> *'Put all the meat in the barbecue.' -- Portuguese soccer coach*

Even the «dirty stuff»: «pawn sacrifices», bribes and lying are examples of «dirty stuff».<br>
They can be effective but use them *only* on life changing situations: it's a scar for life.

> *'Get others to do the work for you, but always take the credit.'<br>
'Keep your hands clean.' -- Robert Greene (7th and 26th law of power)*

When nothing else works, [surrender](#on-surrendering). Only use anger and go [all in](#on-desperate-opponents) if you can see the end already.



===
###On defeating status quo

The only successful changes are those coming from within.

> *'To successfully change a status quo maintained by a minority you only need to unite the majority. How?<br>
Make a non-violent revolution: low risk will make more people to participate.' -- Srdja Popovic*

###On finishing

Finish it. [Going halfway](#on-focus) is too expensive to do it often.

It's not just about winning. The way you win sets you up for the next round.

###On surrendering

Use this opportunity to re-create yourself.<br>
'It only hurts when you don't have time to prepare for the fall' -- Tony Hawk

> *'Surrender conceals great power: lulling the enemy into complacency, it give you time to recoup, time to undermine, time for revenge.'*

> *'Use the surrender tactic: transform weakness into power.'<br>
'Re-create yourself.' -- Robert Greene (22nd and 25th law of power)*

###On past and memory

You are your memory but *let go* your past [failures](#on-mistakes-and-failure).<br>
They are meant to guide you, not to define you or determine your future.

> *'Half of the game is learning how to forget events in the past that eat away at you and cloud your reason.'*

> *'He'd wasted most of his life thinking he'd wasted most of his life'*

> *'Never regret something that once made you smile.'*

> *'Stop looking for happiness in the same place where you lost it.'*

> *'You can't start the next chapter of your life if you keep re-reading the last one.'*

> *'I don’t know any longer whether I’m living or remembering.' -- Albert Camus*

How memory works? People forget by decaying and giving them other stuff to remember.

> *'People forget future events more than past events.'*

> *'People remember more the beginning and the end of something.'*

> *'Repetition is good for memory but its a thin line between repetition and getting annoyed.'* 



===
###On present

You will die soon. Act accordingly and don't postpone joy.

> *'Every day in the mirror I watch death at work.' -- Jean Cocteau*

> *'We are like butterflies who flutter for a day and think it's forever.'*

> *'Now will not be with us forever.'*

###On intelligence and talent

Genius and talent are rare, and as such, the most sensitive trigger points for envy.

> *'In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts; they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty.' -- Ralph Waldo Emerson*

> *'Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent. It takes a touch of genius, and a lot of courage, to move in the opposite direction.'*

> *'I think we have an ideology about talent that says that talent is a tangible, resilient, hardened, shiny thing. It will always rise to the top. To find and encourage talent, all you have to do as a society, is to make sure the right doors are open. Free campus visits, free tuition, letters to the kids with high score. You raise your hand and say, «over here!» and the talent will come running, but that's not true. It’s not resilient and shiny, talent is really, really fragile.' -- Malcolm Gladwell*

> *'To reveal the true nature of your intelligence rarely pays; you should get in the habit of downplaying it at all times.'*

###On wealth

Being rich is not counting money all day but being fulfilled.

> *'Life, is not a having and a getting, but a being and a becoming.' -- Myrna Loy*

> *'Shift your focus from achievement to fulfillment:<br>
What makes you come alive, what do you enjoy doing, who do you enjoy being around?'*

> *'Some people are so poor, all they have is money.'*

> *'It's nice to have a lot of money, but you know, you don't want to keep it around forever. I prefer buying things. Otherwise, it's a little like saving sex for your old age.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'You can spend your time making money but you can't spend your money making time.'*



===
###On fame

See fame as a multiplier. If you want to impact the world, be famous.

> *'Do everything in public. Other people are facing the same problems. They will identify with you and provide solutions.'<br>
'Do things worthy of making you famous. The audience you build allows you to multiply everything you do across all those people. It increases your impact. It makes it easy to sell something. It makes it easy to come up with products and services. They will ask you or you can ask them.' -- Allen Tucker (adapted)*

###On luck

Unless you’re winning, life will seem hideously unfair to you.<br>
Be positive, luck is a pattern and the pendulum will swing back your way eventually.

> *'«Random» usually means that you haven’t looked long enough to see a pattern emerge.'*

> *'There’s no magic in the world. It’s all math.' -- discrete math professor*

> *'The eternal mystery of the world is its comprehensibility.'*

> *'True good fortune is what you make for yourself. Good fortune: good character, good intentions, good actions.' -- Marcus Aurelius*

> *'God is subtle but he is not malicious.'*

> *'In life, business and relationships we are defined by how we react when things don't go our way.'*

What’s the difference between luck and chance?<br>
Luck is an open door. Chance is the willingness to step through. This creates the illusion that certain people are luckier.

HOWEVER,

> *'Bad luck is normally bad planning.'*

> *'Even a broken clock is right twice a day.'*

> *'Essencialism: the value in less and the joy of missing out.'*

> *'Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.' -- Antoine de Saint-Exupéry*

> *'Run away from complexity. Complexity doesn't add much to life.'*

###On investment

Spend less, a lot less, than you make. Stay liquid. Never invest in anything you can’t sell in 30 days.

> *'Never lose money. Rule No. 2: don’t forget rule No. 1.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'Wherever oil goes, the stock market goes.'*

###On economics and politics

'Morality is the way that we would like the world to be, economics is the way that the world actually works.' -- Steven Levitt

> *'The hardest thing in the world to understand is the income tax.'*

> *'80% of all people are voluntarily overpaying on their taxes.'*

> *'Politicians don't get educated. They get bought.'*

> *'The moment you cross a second border, you are an economic migrant, not a refugee.'*

> *'Good fences make good neighbors.'*

> *'Even the most practical man of affairs is usually in the thrall of the ideas of some long-dead economist.' -- John Maynard Keynes*

###On science and religion

'And on the first day, men created god.'

> *'Science without religion is lame. Religion without science is blind.'*

> *'The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and all science.' -- Albert Einstein*

> *'The whole of science is nothing more than a refinement of everyday thinking.'*

> *'To do science is to search for repeated patterns, not simply to accumulate the facts.' -- Robert MacArthur*

> *'Science is a wonderful thing if one does not have to earn one's living at it.'*

> *'The most exciting phrase to hear in science is not 'Eureka!' but 'That's funny...' -- Isaac Asimov*
