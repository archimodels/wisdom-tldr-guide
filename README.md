> *'Choose a life you want and then create the things you need around it. A girl, a job, a friend, all of those should help you achieve the life you want. If it doesn’t, get rid of it.'*

You are your deeds;

Have personal accountability;

	               __/

> *'52 approaches in a year is more than most men make in a lifetime. Consistency is everything.'*



===
###On mastery

First learn the rules, then break them. 

> *'Masters are able to ask the kinds of simple questions that most people pass over.'*

> *'An expert is someone who knows some of the worst mistakes that can be made in his subject, and how to avoid them.' -- Werner Heisenberg*

> *'You want to learn every aspect of that subject, you are expected to be a pro. There is no place for a prima donna.'*

> *'How often our early triumphs turn us into a kind of caricature of ourselves.'*

> *'If you gain any kind of attention or success for your work, you face the great danger of creeping conservatism.'*

> *'Influence is more powerful than money. The reason millionaires are depressed is that they don’t know the difference.'*

> *'Play to people’s fantasies.' -- Robert Greene (32nd law of power)*

> *'The person who clears the path ultimately controls its direction, just as the canvas shapes the painting.' -- Ryan Holiday*



===
###On communication

Management is about communication. Being a boss to be equal parts manager and psychotherapist.

> *'Spend 1 hour a day just talking to your people and everything will be OK.'*

> *'The goal is to move everyone up from «unconfident and incompetent» to «confident and competent». Some people also go through «incompetent and confident», «where the best option is often to stand back and act as a safety net while letting the person learn whatever lesson they needed to learn.' -- exelius*



===
###On delegation

Managing is delegating. Your speed as a manager is the speed of the team.

> *'Your productivity as a manager is measured as the productivity of your team. Being seated making stuff is not productive.
The key principle is putting your team’s productivity first. Remember, you are a communication hub and a multiplier. Think about what is best for others, and think about the things you can delegate vs. the things that only you can do. If you truly work for your people instead of hiding at your desk, just tell yourself: What I accomplished today is not yet visible, but it will be.'*

> *'A manager should make himself 2 questions a day:<br>
«What is important to accomplish?» (where are you going)<br>
«Where was I uncomfortable the day before?» (what went right and where do you need support)<br>
The speed that you offload your stuff will be the speed of your team.'*

> *'Instead of generalizing and saying «management is useless» it is more correct to say «bad management is counterproductive».'*

> *'There are no bad teams, only bad leaders.'*



===
###On giving feedback

A manager shouldn't add his two cents, specially on subjective stuff, unless he's certain the delivered work is not good enough. The outcome doesn't have to be exactly as you expected it to be.

By the other hand, if feedback is needed, give a reason.

> *'Try «can you take another look at this for XYZ reasons?». This gives the employee ownership of the final deliverable, while still prompting them to deal with problems they overlooked.'*

> *'«Because» is a great motivator.'*

And ask instead of telling.

> *'«Why did you decide to do X in that order?». This creates a dialog, so the two can discuss what the answer should be, instead of a debate where each side first stakes out positions. Lead your people to discover what you would have suggested. Smart people will get to the same place you were going, or you may learn something, if you are humble enough to listen.'*

In any case, [humility](#on-humbleness) is needed for leadership. Pounding directives down or not giving any direction are demotivators for your junior people. Gaining an understanding and giving appropriate feedback makes your juniors feel like what they are doing is important.

> *'«Is that the best you can do?»'*
