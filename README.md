Not even founders themselves can predict how well their own ideas will do. And even if people are convinced your idea is a good idea, they'll still have to compare it to the existing idea they are already working on and see which one they're more likely to do well with. A better, more ambitious idea might seem frightening. A simpler idea might seem more tangible.

###On micro-management

Management is about communication.

A manager should make himself 2 questions a day: 

- «What is important to accomplish?» (where i am I going)

- «Where was I uncomfortable the day before?» (what went right and where do i need support)

The speed that you offload your stuff will be the speed of your team.

> *'The speed of the boss is the speed of the team.'*

Your productivity as a manager is measured as the productivity of your team. Being seated making stuff is not productive.
The key principle is putting your team’s productivity first, instead of your own, individual productivity. Remember, you are a communication hub and a multiplier. Think about what is best for others, and think about the things you can delegate vs. the things that only you can do. If you truly work for your people instead of hiding at your desk, just tell yourself: What I accomplished today is not yet visible. But it will be.

> *'Managing is delegating.'*

> *'Instead of generalizing and saying «management is useless» it is more correct to say «bad management is counterproductive».'*

Being a boss to be equal parts and psychotherapist.

> *'The goal is to move everyone up from "unconfident and incompetent" to "confident and competent". Some people also go through "incompetent and confident", which is also something where the best option is often to stand back and act as a safety net while letting the person learn whatever lesson they needed to learn.' -- exelius*

###On feedback

A boss shouldn't add his two cents, specially on subjective stuff, unless he's certain they're needed. This only works when the delivered work is good enough. You delegate a task, and have an expectation about the outcome. It doesn't have to be exactly as you expected it to be.

But if feedback is needed there's some right ways to give it without violating ownership:

- don't give arbitrary feedback, give a reason («Because» is a great motivator). A common technique I use is "can you take another look at this section for xyz reasons?". This gives the employee ownership of the final deliverable, while still prompting them to deal with problems they overlooked.

- ask instead of telling: eg. «Why did you decide to put the slides in that order?» This does a couple things: sometimes, the IC does things for a reason that the boss doesn't know about, and this gives the IC a way to explain to the boss without needing to sound contradictory. It allows the boss a chance to learn when something is done for a good reason, or gets the IC to revisit a decision when not done for a good reason. It also creates a dialog, so the two can discuss what the answer should be, instead of a debate where each side first stakes out positions.

Absolutely ask question when appropriate, perhaps only ask questions and lead your people to discover what you would have suggested. Smart people will get to the same place you were going, or you may learn something, if you are humble enough to listen!

In any case, humility is needed for leadership. Pounding directives down on junior people is absolutely a demotivator. Not giving any direction is also very demotivational. Gaining an understanding (broad or specific, as the case may be) and giving appropriate feedback makes your juniors feel like what they are doing is important.
