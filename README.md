###On feedback and micro management

A boss shouldn't add his two cents, specially on subjective stuff, unless he's certain they're needed.

This only works when the work they deliver is "good enough". You delegate a task, and have an expectation about the outcome. It doesn't have to be exactly as you expected it to be, but as long as it's good enough you don't have to give them you're 2c.

If so, give a reason: «You should use the blue that's in the style guide because we agreed as a team that's the shade of blue we should use.» Making arbitrary, small changes is not helpful, but a boss/manager/supervisor/etc should suggest small changes when there's a good reason, and should provide that reason.

> *'«Because» is a great motivator.'*

And ask instead of telling: eg «Why did you decide to put the slides in that order?» This does a couple things: sometimes, the IC does things for a reason that the boss doesn't know about, and this gives the IC a way to explain to the boss without needing to sound contradictory. It allows the boss a chance to learn when something is done for a good reason, or gets the IC to revisit a decision when not done for a good reason. It also creates a dialog, so the two can discuss what the answer should be, instead of a debate where each side first stakes out positions.

Henry Kissinger and simply ask, «Is that the best you can do?»

Management is about communication. As a manager, you have to have a lot of conversations.
Your productivity as a manager is measured as the productivity of your team. being seated making stuff is not productive.
I think the key principle is putting your team’s productivity first, instead of your own, individual productivity. Remember, you are a communication hub and a multiplier. Think about what is best for others, and think about the things you can delegate vs. the things that only you can do.
managing is delegating.
If you spend a lot of your time coding, you are preferring an activity that also others can do to something that only you can do.
If you ever feel that way, and if you truly work for your people instead of hiding at your desk, just tell yourself: What I accomplished today is not yet visible. But it will be.
