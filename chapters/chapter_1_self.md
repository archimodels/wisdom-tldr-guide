# 1.1 - On foundations

### On identity

You are your deeds.

> *'Weakness of attitude becomes weakness of character.' -- Albert Einstein*

<!--
> *'If you can’t do the little things right you will never do the big things right' -- Admiral McRaven*
-->

Living is choosing.

a) Choose to be your best self. You need to come alive.<br>
Is succeeding at mediocrity a worthwhile life?

> *'Waking up to who you are requires letting go of who you imagine yourself to be.' -- Alan Watts*

> *'Don’t ask yourself what the world needs, ask yourself what makes you come alive and go do that. Because what the world needs is more people to come alive.' -- Howard Thurman*

> *'The definition of a man is and should be an evolving target. Never stop working on yourself. Always strive to be better.'*

> *'Be the person your dog thinks you are.' -- J.W. Stephens*

<a id="on-trust"></a>b) Choose to keep your integrity.<br>
It's the only way to be respected and build trust.

> *'Seek respect, not attention. It lasts longer.'*

<!--
bravery is learned -> micro-bravery, start small

2. Understand the Effect of Your Childhood Conditioning 
The first step to changing this conditioning is to simply become aware of it.
So take the time now to truly understand what your beliefs and patterns are in every area of life.

For some of you, you must make the conscious decision that you are going to change your story.
No matter where you are in your life, you have the power to change everything in an instant.

If you want to be successful then you must take full responsibility for everything in your life and everything not in your life.
Your results are yours and yours alone. Your choices determined the body, bank account, and relationships that you have right now.

Take Extreme Ownership. why? when are willing to swallow your pride and take ownership of your life and success, you will cultivate respect for yourself and respect from others.

Humility With forward action: 'I wasn’t the smartest in X but..'

Life is About Who You Become Not What You Achieve
On this journey called life, many people lose sight of what is really important.
They believe that material wealth, sexual experiences, and physical prowess are what makes a man.
But the reality is, life is about the man that you become, not the things that you do or the possessions that you gather.
It’s about your character.
It’s about who you impact, the way you show up in the world, and the way that you treat those around you.

integrity is what you think is what you say, and the same what you do.
being vulnerable is taking don't be afraid of taking a risk.

Generosity without Expectation is Sexy
It means that your thoughts, words, and actions are all in congruence.
you don’t live a life that is incongruent with what you want to make others happy.
You live a life of congruence where everything is in line.
This is the pathway to true power.

1 - i approve of me.
2 - i am my word.
5 - i keep my word / i take nothing she says seriously, helps me relax.

Part of being a man is being a protector.protector of everyone who comes into your life.
Part of Being a Man is Getting Shit Done
As an occasional treat, video games or TV are not inherently bad, but we live in a society where most men waste 3+ hours a day in a virtual world when they should be getting shit done.

Background values will change how you think

do you want short term popularity or long term respect

5Cs: courage, congruence, confidence, calibration, conviction

Show respect to others. Respect others and earn the respect of others. That is where true manliness lies.

Manhood is Defined by Your Values and Your Code
(integrity, honor, service, and generosity should be at the top of your list)

You need to develop an unshakable identity as a high achiever and peak performer before you can expect to achieve highly or perform at your peak.

4. Focus on Vulnerability, Not Perfection
The world responds to vulnerability, not meticulously written articles that require a month of editing.
Be raw, be real, tell people what is really going on. The more vulnerable you are, the more people will be able to relate with you and the more of an impact you will be able to have. Don’t try to be perfect. Just be real and the results will come.

> *'A way to humble yourself is to put you in the position of being the weakest person in something during the day.'*

> *'Everyone you will ever meet knows something you don't.' -- Bill Nye*

HOWEVER... live in accordance with your nature. If you try to be something you're not, you end up being nothing.

### On freedom

Choose *yourself*. Choose to be independent.<br>
Tell *your* truth no matter what.

> *'Do not commit to anyone.' -- Robert Greene (20th law of power)*

> *'That’s the problem with putting others first: you’ve taught them you come second.'*

> *'Choose a life you want and then create the things you need around it. A girl, a job, a friend, all of those should help you achieve the life you want. If it doesn’t, get rid of it.'*

> *'There comes a time when you ought to start doing what you want. Take a job that you love. You will jump out of bed in the morning. I think you are out of your mind if you keep taking jobs that you don't like because you think it will look good on your resume.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.' -- Ralph Waldo Emerson*

> *'You have only so much energy and so much time. Every moment wasted on the affairs of others subtracts from your strength.'*

> *'At the core of every man is the desire to be free yet ironically men often confine themselves to a cage.'*

HINT:

> *'If I loved myself at a level 10 of 10, would i do this?'*

Optimizing happiness on a personal level vs. succumbing to what society says will make you happy.

> *'Freedom is not giving a f*ck.' -- Dorian Yates*

3. Take Care of Yourself First
Take care of your emotions, spend time with people you love, pursue your hobbies and passions, and be grateful for what you have in your life.
Take care of yourself and the money, love, and prosperity will follow.

look for 100% financial freedom

The freedom to express oneself fully.

-Commit to yourself: it starts by learning to value yourself and the commitments that you are making.

set boundaries
Practice doing without things you think you need.

3. You Have to Make the Definite Decision to Succeed
The only thing separating you from your wildest dreams and ambitions is that you have not yet made the definite decision to achieve them.

You Need to Stand Up for Yourself
Never be afraid to stand up for yourself, your friends, or your values, because at the end of the day it is better to live a short life where you face your fears

What is more selfless?
-Making sure that you are taken care of so that you can take care of others?
-Or focusing all of your energy on others until you are burnt out, angry, and depressed?

### On gratefulness and happiness

'Happiness = reality / expectations'

Seek happiness actively (action) and passively (lower expectations). Derived from:

> *'Need to jump start happiness? Lower your expectations.' -- James Altucher*

> *'Happiness is not a goal, it is a byproduct.' -- Eleanor Roosevelt*

> *'Happiness is a journey, not a destination.' -- Ben Sweetland*

> *'Happy life = mastery + belonging + autonomy.'*

> *'Happiness is inside you, not with another person.'*

How to improve reality? Act, be patient and break long term goals into smaller ones so you can enjoy the journey.

> *'A pessimist sees a difficulty in every opportunity. An optimist sees an opportunity in every difficulty.'*

> *'While optimists will sometimes mistake a steaming turd for pure gold, they will not miss a piece of genuine gold when it crosses their path.'*

> *'We have the idea that comfort brings happiness. Happiness comes from not having fear.'*

> *'We derive our true sense of fulfillment from constantly pursuing a life of «uncomfortability».'*

> *'The minute you're satisfied with where you are, you aren't there anymore.' -- Tony Gwynn*

How to lower your expectations? Be grateful.

> *'Being grateful is looking down.'*

> *'If you concentrate on what you don’t have, you will never, ever have enough.' -- Oprah Winfrey*

> *'Comparison is the thief of joy.' -- Theodore Roosevelt*

> *'Manage with bread and butter until God sends the honey.' -- Moroccan proverb*

# 1.2 - On growth

### On finding a path

Cancel your pity party. No one is coming to save you.<br>
Pull yourself together and take total ownership for everything in your life.

> *'If you are feeling lost in life, you need to experience more things.'*

> *'What do you do for fun? What are you interested in that everybody in the world is interested in?'*

> *'Take some time away from all external influences and really decide what you want for yourself in the areas of health, wealth, relationships, and personal growth. Then, do it.'*

> *'Let your fear be your guide. The more fear you feel, the more you will know you are on the right track.'*

write how will look this day. dream big. write it with no fear and read it once a year.
these things can make a difference.
exercise: what would be your life if you wouldnt have fear of failure of life.

Scott’s story is not about movies, or addiction, or creativity, it’s about knowing the right direction to take the next step.

Step 1: FIND OUT WHAT YOU’RE CRAVING:
These are the two types of cravings:
a) Addiction: I felt powerless. I was addicted to money. More was never enough. Then I left Wall Street. Because they were the supplier.
b) Depletion: Your body needs something. It can be water, a vitamin or mineral or a change. That’s where reinvention comes in.

Creating a vision for your life and achieving that vision is possible.

The reason that most people are not fulfilled in the work that they do isn’t because they haven’t found their “calling” but rather because they are bored and disengaged.

Fulfillment in Any Endeavor Comes from Variety and Engagement 
Most people continue to chase down their ever elusive “calling”.
You know, that one thing that if they do not do it, they have wasted their entire life and skillsets on trivial activities and distractions.
Allow me to share a little secret with you. This doesn’t exist.

Figure out what you want out of life and figure out how much money you will need to make it happen, then start taking the steps necessary to get there.

search for actionable steps\

When you look at your bank account and don’t like what you see, you need to remember that these results were caused by your thoughts. They were caused by your beliefs, your decisions, and your values that were then projected into your reality.

– Have a Mission
Every day, whether it’s “be creative today.” Or “go some place you’ve never been” or “talk to ten random strangers”, make a mission.
Learn something new.
Missions are for people who DO. Mission statements are for people who DON’T.

What do you really want?
- What do the actions of your past suggest is most important to you?
- What desires do you have that don't align with your past behavior.
- What future path does your past behavior suggest rather than your imagination?
- If you don't like these answers, change your existing behavior.
Spend more time doing the things you really want to do.
Getting very clear about what is important allows you to stop caring so much about things that are unimportant.

What does it mean to be you? Who are you?

“It seems so easy because you hang out with yourself all day,” she said. “But it’s so easy to get distracted by who you feel you should be… or who you wish you were. Or who other people expect you to be.”
it’s OK to stop doing things that should make you feel good, but don’t.

Step 1: Do less of what you don’t like doing -- unless it is limiting you
Step 2: Do more of what you like doing
Step 3: Use envy
“Envy is painful, but it’s a very helpful emotion for a happy life. It’s a giant red arrow sign standing over someone’s head saying, ‘They've got something you want.’”

> *'It’s hard to beat a person who never gives up.' -- Babe Ruth*

> *'Work until your idols become your rivals.'*

> *'Work hard in silence. Let your silence be your noise.'*

> *'How much time do you consume vs produce? Are you watching others do things you could be doing if you weren’t watching them.' -- Allen Tucker*

HOWEVER... don't be thirsty: the [journey](#on-gratefulness-and-happiness) will not be enjoyable and people will [envy](#on-outliers) you.

If You Are Not Growing You Are Dying
Life is about constant and never-ending growth.
If you want to live your life in such a way that you can take your final breath with a smile on your face, then you must be willing to commit yourself to constant growth.F!ck complacency.
I don’t care if you have $10,000,000 in the bank account, a model wife, and all the material possessions this world has to offer, if you are not pushing yourself to grow and expand, you are digging yourself an early grave.
Never settle in life, never be content with who you are and what you have achieved.
You have to constantly push yourself to do more, achieve more, and, most importantly become more.

Most 16 year olds are just using their phones to send silly snaps to their friends and watch porn.
And most people waste their lives away in 9-5 jobs. It's not an age thing.

“We must suffer one of two pains, either the pain of discipline or the pain of regret and disappointment.”

lying in death bed and regretting your life is the worst that can happen to you.

We know about quitting something that’s bad for you, or something you hate. But what about quitting something you love?
I can tell you from experience, it leaves a lot of room for change.
I still love everything I quit. But not as much as I love all this room for change._sivers

Most of the entrepreneurs I know love what they do, but they do not love it because they feel it is their life’s purpose.

So instead of looking for your life’s purpose, look for things that will stretch you, engage you, and teach you.

Because that is where you will find true fulfillment and satisfaction.

### On comfort and risk

You need to break rules to achieve anything great.<br>
Breaking rules [frightens](#on-fear-and-excuses) people but comfort is the enemy of achievement.

> *'If we play by the rules too strictly, if we take them too literally, we are crushed by those around us who are not so foolish.'*

> *'If you think adventure is dangerous, try routine. It's lethal.' -- Paulo Coelho*

> *'Normality is a paved road: It’s comfortable to walk, but no flowers grow on it.' -- Van Gogh*

> *'There is pleasure in the pathless woods.' -- Lord Byron*

> *'A ship is safe in the harbor but that's not what ships are for.'*

> *'Think of yourself as an explorer. You cannot find anything new if you are unwilling to leave the shore.'*

> *'You can choose courage or you can choose comfort, but you can't choose both.'*

> *'Take risk. Big audacious risk. You’ll never get what you want in life without it.'*

> *'Choose the hard way. Life is easy, and a soft life makes for soft people. Take a cold shower, join a boxing gym, use the stairs instead of the escalator, go out in nature alone for a week.'*

<!--
1. The Goal of Life is Not Comfort it’s Contribution
Society has tried to convince us that the ultimate goal of our lives is to increase our comfort.
But the problem with this philosophy is that no great work ever came from comfort.

Avoiding stress is avoiding life.

Reinvention should be an habit not an event.

if you are not growing you are dying
stepping outside what is easy and embracing discomfort.

risk over safety is the way to pull forward.

Risk Leads to Growth and Excitement

Risk looks different for everyone.

2.Suffering is a Temporary But Essential Part of Life

So adventure is more than just grist for future storytelling — it’s a way to learn optimally. And like anything that promotes self-improvement, it’s not always a comfortable process. “We need to be willing to grow,” says Jon. “We need to be willing to be uncomfortable.”

You will live a life that is filled with more excitement and fulfillment the more you take intentional risks.

> *'But how can you live and have no story to tell?' -- Fyodor Dostoyevsky*

> *'The size of our life is in direct proportion to how uncomfortable we are willing to be'*

1. To Improve Your Life, You First First Become Uncomfortable
If you want to improve the quality of your life, then start by improving your tolerance for risk and adversity.
Because almost everything that you want is on the other side of the uncomfortable and the scary.

Adventure Comes from Percieved Risk, Not Peril
develop a tolerance for risk so that you can build up to the scarier activities later.

> *'Out of suffering have emerged the strongest souls; the most massive characters are seared with scars.' -- Kahlil Gibran*

I sort of became comfortable with being uncomfortable to the point where now…if I start getting comfortable, I feel like I’m not learning anything and that I might be in a bubble.

parabola do sapo e da agua a ferver

To become stronger, you must push against resistance, you must struggle, you must sweat, and you must bleed.
If you want your relationship to be stronger, you will have to face resistance. You cannot have a thriving marriage and never face adversity together.
> *'To risk nothing is to risk even more'*

### On habits and systems

Consistency doesn’t come from effort, it comes from systems. Decisions compound.

> *'We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.' -- Will Durant*

Will Durant “You are what you repeatedly do, excellence, therefore, is not an action, but a habit“.

> *'52 approaches in a year is more than most men make in a lifetime. Consistency is everything.'*

> *'Volume usually outpaces intensity. You can’t just put in a huge effort a few times.' -- Allen Tucker*

> *'The pathway to freedom is discipline.'*

Create high value systems: [meditate](#on-meditation), spend time outside, [rest](#on-health), travel, learn useful skills.<br>
Avoid low value systems: social media, news, owning a TV, working long hours, control of petty stuff, perfectionism..

> *'Go for a walk in the morning and decide what would make the day a successful day.' -- Allen Tucker*

> *'Use social media as an output not as entertainment. Your phone should not be the first thing you see in the morning nor the last thing you see at night.' -- Allen Tucker*

> *'It makes other people’s stories more interesting when you don’t know what’s going on outside your world. The news causes completely unnecessary stress and it’s negatively biased.' -- Allen Tucker*

HINT: Mental checklist of positive habits.

HOWEVER... while routines and habits are important, so is variety and novelty. [Balance](#on-balance) it.

<!--
> *'Hard choices, easy life. Easy choices, hard life.' -- Jerzy Gregorek*

Study successful individuals and you will start to notice patterns that they all follow.
Most of them wake up early, work on a clear schedule, exercise daily, and give 10% of their income to charities.

People who are driven by the fear of missing out or the dream of early adopter super stardom are deploying a “middlebrow inference” that examines only the maximum possible return, not the value derived in expectation.
The opportunity cost of missing a ‘new new thing’ like the airplane and the automobile is minuscule compared to the toxicity of all the garbage one has to go through to get these jewels.”
it’s the rejection of such thinking that has led me to continue to abstain from Facebook and Twitter, among other popular pastimes in the rapidly evolving digital attention casino.

Do whatever you need to do to break your current patterns and start achieving the success that you know you have the potential to achieve.

Use your phone to set reminders for really important things automatically. Turn off push notifications for everything else.

Focus on Showing Up not Achieving Goals 

1) Invest in long-term wellbeing
a. Physical health:
b. One new thing: learn at least one new thing everyday. Read, watch a documentary, look around, observe, engage in a conversation.
c. Be creative: Creativity conquers jealousy, envy, self-pity. It conquers worry. 
d. Gratitude

when you wake up, ensure that your morning is run by systems instead of feelings.

don't focus in productivity.
productivity coach vs creativity coach.
i hired a 23 year old coach.

look at situations as systems. i help to create systems.

Shut off all work and electronics at least 2 hours before you want to go to sleep, sit down with a pen and a notepad and write down everything that you need to achieve the following day in order of importance.

> *'Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.' -- Gandhi*

<!--
Only applied knowledge is power, and if you have spent years devoting your time and energy to learning without taking the proper proportion of action, then it is time to get off your ass, leave the theory on your nightstand, and get in the game

Just in time learning. You can learn faster if you have something your working on rather than some future idea that may not happen. Improves retention, wastes less time.

“We must suffer one of two pains, either the pain of discipline or the pain of regret and disappointment.”
there are consequences for acting and don't acting

4. Education not Schooling is What Separates the Winners from the Losers

2. Start with the Basics

1. Anything You Desire is an Attainable Skill 
Short of physical characteristics like height, bone structure, and other unchangeable genetic factors, anything in your life can be changed.
you can change aspects of your personality that you don’t like And for most people, this is a scary realization. you are now “burdened” with the realization that you are completely responsible for everything in your life and everything not in your life.

2. To Lead a Balanced and Healthy Life You Need to Ask the Right Questions
Tony Robbins says that the quality of your life is based on the quality of the questions that you ask yourself.
If you are facing health struggles, you need to ask yourself these three questions to truly uncover the root cause of the issues in your life.
1) What Are You Holding On To?What happened in your life that you are still angry, depressed, or frustrated with? What are you really holding onto that is holding you back.
2) What is Life trying to Teach You?How can you reframe the thing that you are holding onto into something good? What is life trying to teach you through that struggle.
3) How Can I Move On?What steps do you need to take to move on with your life? Who do you need to forgive, what needs to be said, who needs to be removed from your life?

Write advice to yourself or other people. Review it regularly. Edit it. Refine it. It worked for Marcus Aurelius and it worked for Bruce Lee.
I’ve started a list of advice or things I know. Perhaps things I believe I know. Some of these are lessons I’ve learned the hard way, others are lessons I’ve observed in others. This process reminds us of what’s most important and helps us to avoid making the same mistakes in the future. I will edit and add to this over time. Try making your own list and I think it will be worth your time.

If you’re not getting better today, you’re getting worse.”

### On feedback

Feedback speeds up improvement.<br>
Mentors are your best source of feedback. Only take advice from them.

> *'Build your Board of Directors. Mentors and friends who are achieving on a higher level than you who are willing to call you out on your failures and lift you up for your successes. Once you build this infrastructure of support and accountability, your life will radically transform.'*

> *'I’d rather have criticism from a genius than praise from an idiot.'*

> *'Follow the thought leaders instead of the traffic leaders.'*

> *'Find mentors to help you improve, even virtual mentors as a good book.'*

> *'A coach spots your bullshit before you open your mouth.'*

You cannot give what you do not have, and the first step to truly serving others is to serve yourself.
Take time for yourself, allow yourself to recharge and recuperate, invest into your growth and education.
Then, and only then, will you be fully equipped and able to serve others to your fullest capacity.

### On success

There is no shortcut to the top. Success is a castle that you build [brick by brick](#on-habits-and-systems).<br>
Success is not being [wealthy](#on-wealth) but being [happy](#on-gratefulness-and-happiness).

> *'Success is peace of mind which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you did your best to become the best you are capable of becoming.' -- John Woode*

> *'Success is simple, but it is not easy. Success is nothing but the accumulation of small things done consistently over a long period of time.'*

> *'Success doesn’t come to you. You go to it.' -- Marva Collins*

> *'Try not to become a man of success, rather become a man of value' -- Albert Einstein*

HOWEVER... [doubt](#on-confidence-and-validation), not failure, is the biggest barrier to success.

<!--
Succeeding means securing advantage.

> *'It’s never your identity, it’s always your strategy'*

Success is subjective. If you wake up each morning, happy, fulfilled, and full of life, then you are a success.

1. All of Success is About Conquering Yourself
Most people assume that success is all about the mechanics.
Guess what, no matter what you are striving for, you will face failure at some point in your life, however, if you have developed yourself, if you have conquered your own emotions of fear, doubt, and unconfidence, you can return from any failure and be victorious.

1. Success is in Our Decisions Not Our Conclusions
Many people think that success is about the attainment of something, but the truth is, success is about who you become along the way and the decisions that you make.
Success is truly about living a life with honor and integrity, not any material outcome.

success is not the accumulation of stuff

If you want to succeed at anything in your life, then forget about the Joneses.
You don’t need the fancy car, expensive watch, or flashy toys, spend your money on experiences, on your family, and on living a lifestyle that makes you happy. Don’t spend it on getting into a meaningless competition with shallow and materialistic people.

True fulfillment comes from living your life, not from achievement.

Success is Internal not External: If you want to achieve true fulfillment, then realize that happiness is internal.

If you want to succeed at anything in your life, then forget about the Joneses.
You don’t need the fancy car, expensive watch, or flashy toys, spend your money on experiences, on your family, and on living a lifestyle that makes you happy. Don’t spend it on getting into a meaningless competition with shallow and materialistic people

Experiences worth more than material

“The things we do that get us to feel the true, deep sense of accomplishment are things like running a marathon, climbing a mountain, writing a book, and inventing something,”

The key to all success in life lies in education and massive action.
If you are not constantly expanding your mind, skill sets, and patterns of thought, then you are contracting them.

The story he told me was a combination of luck, learning skills, building a network, and acting on the intersection of all of the above. But more than anything, it’s being open to surrender. Surrendering to constant reinvention.

### On stress and health

Take care of your body. It’s the most important thing you’ll get for free.<br>
HOWEVER... the origin of most health problems is not physical but mental.

> *'There are links between mental health and physical health. Physical stress avoids need for control.'*

> *'Body language affects your psychology, your mood, and even your hormonal balance.'*

> *'Action cures everything. Plain and simple.'*

Stress is caused by under-stimulation or over-stimulation (worrying about the [past](#on-past) or the [future](#on-future)).<br>
The more relaxed you are, the better you are at everything.

> *'Under-stimulation = boredom <br>
right amount of stress = hustling (stretching comfort zone) <br>
over-stimulation = anxiety'*

> *'Depression is a lack of your expression.' -- Scott Steindorff

You weren’t made to spend 10 hours a day staring at a screen in a cubicle arguing over email. If you do this your body will fall apart. As your body falls apart so will your brain. As your brain goes so does your chances of success or happiness.' -- Allen Tucker

- The cure for worry? Presence (as recently discussed with Amy Cuddy, author of Presence: Bringing Your Boldest Self to Your Biggest Challenges). Focus on the task at hand. Face forward, but don’t live in the pretend future where the thing you’re fearing wins.

<!-- ligar com #on-control -->

> *'Anxiety is linked with our wired out evolutionarily for a [need of control](#on-control). Anxiety is not planning, anxiety is to go on continuously over any kind of scenario. Past is only in your head. What's important is present and future. We don't control anything, at most we influence some stuff.'*

> *'Worry is a misuse of the imagination.'*

<!-- 
You can’t perform under pain, stress, etc. without adequate capacity. That capacity is physical.

You mind is a made of physical things. Neurons, chemicals, electricity. Your physical state, capacity for physical stress, sleep, diet, experiences, determine the bulk of your mental state. Do not rely upon cognition to make change. Behavior and the physical world are your key to changing affect and cognition. Your mental performance IS physical performance.

> *'If I had to prescribe two things to improve health and happiness in the world, it’s movement and play.' -- Jason Nemer*

When most people are struggling with pain, they fail to realize that often times, their pain is caused by a mental or emotional problem and not a physical problem. This could stem from a childhood trauma, a tragic event, or simply a personal insecurity.
Reframe Your Pain and Become Grateful 
The simple truth is, it is hard to be in pain when you are in a state of gratitude and love. 5. Release the Pain. Be grateful for how it helped you become the man you are, but accept that you no longer need it in your life and let it go.

If you feel powerless/being dominated you will be chronically stressed.

Your limits are where are your fears.

> *'Your beliefs determine your reality. Nothing can sabotage you more quickly and more completely than limiting beliefs.'*

> *'The only person standing in your way is you.' -- Black Swan*

HOWEVER... your level of success will seldom exceed your level of personal development.

> *'You'll never have fear of loss when you give more value to lessons than successes.'*

> *'Expose yourself to your deepest fear; after that, fear has no power, and the fear of freedom shrinks and vanishes. You are free. -- Jim Morrison*

Anger and excuses are fear clothed. All excuses are refutable.

People will do anything, no matter how absurd, in order to avoid facing their own Soul.'*

### On shame

Speaking openly about an imperfection is a sign of strength, not a weakness.<br>
You are not you think you are: *you are what you hide*.

<!--
You can hide the ugly parts, but you can't make them disappear.
-->

> *'Imperfections are attractive when their owners are happy with them.' -- Augusten Burroughs*

> *'Comfort in our failures allows us to act without fear, to engage without judgment, to love without conditions.'*

### On confidence and validation

If you say it with confidence, you are who you say you are.

> *'You're only as good as your next speech.'*

> *'A speech is a performance. Authenticity is crucial.'*

> *'Believe you can, and you’re half way there.'*

Don’t wait for someone to tell you that you are special. If the universe didn't need you, you wouldn't be here.

> *'Having a low opinion of yourself is not modesty. It’s self-destruction.' -- Bobby Sommer*

> *'Value yourself. The only people who appreciate a doormat are people with dirty shoes.' -- Leo Buscaglia*

> *'Let go of your ego and your need for validation.'*

[Mastery](#on-mastery) and [core values](#on-identity) are good sources of confidence.<br>
In the meanwhile any source is good. Don't stop till you get it.

> *'If you don't believe in yourself. Believe in me who believes in you.'*

> *'Fake it till you make it.'*

<a id="on-arrogance"></a>HOWEVER... know the frontier between confidence and arrogance.

> *'Confidence is not walking into a room thinking you are better than everyone, it's walking in not having to compare yourself with anyone at all.'*

> *'Ego is the enemy. People say that you can't fly and then you flew. Then you think you are God.'*

> *'Controlling the impression that you make on others takes a large amount of cognitive bandwidth and everything will appear as fake.'*

> *'Arrogance is a smokescreen for insecurity.' -- Amy Cuddy*

Confidence is a result, not a requirement

confidence relies on pride
