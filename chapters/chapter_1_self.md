# 1.1 - On foundations

### On independence

*'A man is free at the instant he wants to be.' -- Voltaire*

Choose *yourself*. Choose to be independent.

> *'My independence is my legacy.' -- Bagão Felix (politician)*
  
Choose a life you want and then create the things you need around it. Take care of yourself first and the money, love, and prosperity will follow. A girl, a job, a friend, all of those should help you achieve it. If it doesn’t, get rid of it. Energy and time are limited so every moment wasted on the affairs of others subtracts from your strength. Healthy people will respect your boundaries.

Telling *your* truth is not being selfish. What is more selfless? Making sure that you are taken care of so that you can take care of others or focusing all of your energy on others until you are burnt out, angry, and depressed? You cannot give what you do not have. the first step to truly serving others is to serve yourself. Take time for yourself, allow yourself to recharge and recuperate, invest into your growth and education. Then, and only then, will you be fully equipped and able to serve others to your fullest capacity.

> *'I think the reward for conformity is that everyone likes you except yourself.' -- Rita Mae Brown*

> *'I cannot give you the formula for success, but I can give you the formula for failure, which is: try to please everybody.' -- Herbert Swope*

> *'That’s the problem with putting others first: you’ve taught them you come second.'*

> *'Selfishness is not living as one wishes to live, it is asking others to live as one wishes to live.' -- Oscar Wilde*

Stand up for yourself, your friends, or your values, because at the end of the day it is better to live a short life where you face your fears. A boundary is knowing what you want and what you don't want in a moment. E.g: «If I loved myself at a level 10 of 10, would I do this?»

> *'Freedom is not free. It is earned. It is taken. It is wrestled from the jaws of fear and uncertainty and doubt.' -- Dan Kariv*

> *'Never explain: your friends do not need it, and your enemies will not believe you anyway.' -- Elbert Hubbard*

Codependent no more: How to stop controlling others and start caring for yourself.

we dont need to like everybody. dot. being nice is not being able to tolerate the other being upset with him. niceness leads to passivity they don't rise to leadership positions. a nice person can't be angry -> then it manifest as depression, anxiety, health problems, passive agressiveness
resentment is created when we say yes when we want to say no.

One of the best days of my life was the day I took the elevator down to freedom. It was the middle of the day. I walked out. No boxes. No handshakes. I left and played chess in Union Square. The same place I got my first client after starting my own company.

Your lifestlyle depends on your independence. The freedom to express oneself fully.

Practice doing without things you think you need.
Once we’re bought, it’s hard to get out. While we all start out wanting more independence, we increasingly live lifestyles that make us dependent.
The bank owned them. Work owned them.

I define financial freedom as: “The ability to do what you want when you want, where you want, and with whom you want… within reason”.
look for 100% financial freedom

3. You have to make the definite decision to succeed. The only thing separating you from your wildest dreams and ambitions is that you have not yet made the definite decision to achieve them.

> *'Men occasionally stumble over the truth, but most of them pick themselves up and hurry off as if nothing ever happened.' -- Winston Churchill*
> *'Quem não chora não mama.'*	
> *'How we spend our days is how we spend our lives.' -- Annie Dillard*	
> *'Só os mais corajosos conseguem fazer a paz' -- Trump*

There have been times where I felt conflicted and confused, where I mourned for a past self that I knew I would never see again while anxiously awaiting a future self who seemingly would never come. Old habits, both good and bad, have fallen by the wayside while I’ve picked up both good and bad habits to fill their space. mm

> *'Wisdom is nothing more profound than an ability to follow one’s own advice.' -- Sam Harris*

- There are many yous: Like apps on a smartphone, different systems in your brain with different goals can take control at different times, which is why you can behave so inconsistently. Meditation can prevent hijacking: Over time, meditation can rewire your brain to be less impulsively reactive and allow you to thoughtfully respond to your feelings. Mini-meditations help in the moment: By focusing on your breath during a tense moment you can get some of the long term effects of meditation right when you need them.

### On authenticity

*'To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.' -- Ralph Waldo Emerson*

Choose authenticity. Live in accordance with your nature. If you try to be something you're not, you end up being nothing.
Authenticity isn’t the presence of something, but the absence of everything that isn’t authentic.

the best value u can add is by being more of yourself not by changing.

Focus on vulnerability, not perfection. The world responds to vulnerability, not meticulously written articles that require a month of editing.
Be raw, be real, tell people what is really going on. The more vulnerable you are, the more people will be able to relate with you and the more of an impact you will be able to have. Don’t try to be perfect. Just be real and the results will come.

> *'If something is holding you back, recognize it and fix it, but you don’t have to be great at everything. Find your context. You don't need to suceed in every context. You’re not going to succeed at stuff you don’t want to do.'*

- meta acting. some people with no studies were much better on this than anyone I knowed. autenthic voice on your craft.
- make your followers share their motivations and use it to make them do what must be done.
- keep it real, don't show yourself too perfect.
- If you’re trying to be authentic, you’re not being authentic. What you can do, however, is stop being inauthentic. It’s not that we’re learning how to be authentic, but that we’re un-learning inauthenticity. If authenticity is the feeling of being your real self, then we can define inauthenticity as the feeling of not being your real self.
- People know when they’re talking to the real thing.
- Corollary to the authenticity paradox: you can be inauthentic by doing what seems authentic (that is, what feels most comfortable), and you can be more authentic by trying things that feel inauthentic (that is, new thoughts and behaviors that are uncomfortable simply because they’re new).
- The first step is to notice when it arises. Then, listen to that instinct. Next, take a moment and have a laugh.
- Finally, you have to be willing to put your inauthenticity aside.

honesty everywhere. i dont want to be in place where i cant be honest.
i want to make relationships with a long term prospect.
flat hierarchy. i dont want to be around hierarchical systems. i want to treat everybody as a peer.

Personal branding will kill you. Personal DOING will save everyone around you.
people justify all kinds of mistakes to preserve the personal narratives they are invested in
Countries rewrite their histories, from the textbook up, to support how they see themselves now.

CHANGE YOUR ACTIONS, NOT YOURSELF

Your identity is this made up thing that you’re emotionally attached to. It’s a mirage in the desert. And the quickest way to change yourself is to realize that there’s no real self to change.

i approve of me. i am my word. i keep my word / i take nothing she says seriously, helps me relax.

Part of being a man is being a protector of everyone who comes into your life.

Manhood is Defined by Your Values and Your Code
(integrity, honor, service, and generosity should be at the top of your list)

Always remain diligent. Have no careless Days. Fate loves to play tricks, and will heap up chances to catch us unawares. Our intelligence, prudence, and courage, even our beauty, must always be ready for trial. For their day of careless trust will be that of their discredit. Care always fails just when it was most wanted.

> *'Words are deeds.' -- Ludwig Wittgenstein*
> *'You become what you think about all day long.' -- Ralph Waldo Emerson*

Work for a cause, not for applause. Live life to express, not to impress. Don’t strive to make your presence noticed, just make your absence felt.
You must play by your rules, funnel your weird stuff to give you some advantage.

### On integrity and accountability

*'Trust, not money, is the currency of business and life.'*

Be impeccable with your word and consciently work on being honest. The only way to build trust is to seek respect.

> *'Be the person your dog thinks you are.' -- J.W. Stephens*

> *'It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it. If you think about that, you’ll do things differently.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'Pay every debt, as if God wrote the bill.' -- Ralph Waldo Emerson*

> *'Quality means doing it right when no one is looking.' -- Henry Ford*

Take extreme ownership. Why? when are willing to swallow your pride and take ownership of your life and success, you will cultivate respect for yourself and respect from others. If you want to be successful then you must take full responsibility for everything in your life and everything not in your life.
Your results are yours and yours alone. Your choices determined the body, bank account, and relationships that you have right now.

> *'With enough courage, you can do without a reputation.' -- Margaret Mitchell*

> *'We are taught you must blame your father, your sisters, your brothers, the school, the teachers - but never blame yourself. It's never your fault. But it's always your fault, because if you wanted to change you're the one who has got to change.' --  Katharine Hepburn*

<!--
> *'Look for results, not salutes.' -- Captain Michael Abrashoff*

bravery is learned -> micro-bravery, start small

Be willing to side with the minority.

Humility With forward action: 'I wasn’t the smartest in X but..'
integrity is what you think is what you say, and the same what you do.
being vulnerable is taking don't be afraid of taking a risk.

### On gratitude and humbleness

Choose humbleness and gratefulness. You are not perfect neither you'll ever be.

> *'Everyone you will ever meet knows something you don't.' -- Bill Nye*

> *'A way to humble yourself is to put you in the position of being the weakest person in something during the day.'*

> *'Being grateful is looking down.'*

> *'If you concentrate on what you don’t have, you will never, ever have enough.' -- Oprah Winfrey*

> *'Comparison is the thief of joy.' -- Theodore Roosevelt*

> *'Manage with bread and butter until God sends the honey.' -- Moroccan proverb*

> *'You can’t be grateful and angry simultaneously.' -- Tony Robbins*

> *'Gratitude is not only the greatest of virtues, but the parent of all the others.' -- Cicero*

> *'How lucky I am to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard.' -- A.A. Milne*

> *'There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self.' -- Ernest Hemingway*

Your success means nothing in life. It’s forgotten in one generation, two at best.
But your emotional health lives for hundreds of generations after in the lives of everyone you touch and their descendants.

<!--
> *'I myself am made entirely of flaws, stitched together with good intentions.' -- Augusten Burroughs*
> *'Knowing others is intelligence; knowing yourself is true wisdom. Mastering others is strength; mastering yourself is true power. If you realize that you have enough, you are truly rich.' -- Lao Tzu*
> *'#332. Nothing is more highly to be prized than the value of each day.' -- Goethe*
> *'When you are grateful, fear disappears and abundance appears.' -- Anthony Robbins*
> *'The frog in the well knows nothing of the mighty ocean.' -- Japanese Proverb*
- A good life is not a life without problems. A good life is a life with good problems. mm
- play the cards you are dealt. And you will often be dealt bad cards.

The simple mantra, “I know nothing” has helped me so many times in the past seven years.
I owe any success to those simple three words: I. Know. Nothing.

I sometimes forget that a group of people blazed the trail I’m enjoying and that another group continues to maintain it without any fanfare.

# 1.2 - On growth

### On finding your path

*'Everyone tells you what to do and what’s good for you. They don’t want you to find your own answers. They want you to believe theirs.' -- Dan Millman*

*'The obstacle is the way.' -- Marcus Aurelius*

Cancel your pity party, no one is coming to save you. Pull yourself together and take total ownership for everything in your life. The path will be revealed as you start walking.

> *'Get yourself into a state of calmness, and then ferocity will take care of itself.' -- Stewart Copeland*

> *'I arise in the morning torn between a desire to improve (or save) the world and a desire to enjoy (or savor) the world. This makes it hard to plan the day.' -- E.B. White*

Hints:

- Let your fear be your guide. The more fear you feel, the more you will know you are on the right track.  
- What do you do for fun? What are you interested in that everybody in the world is interested in?  
- If you are feeling lost in life experience more things.  
- Go where you can make a difference not where you think there’s a home run.  
- When life gets blurry, just adjust your focus.
- It’s easier to ask forgiveness than to get permission.  

> *'I can think, I can wait and I can fast.' -- Siddahrta*

> *'If we’re growing, we’re always going to be out of our comfort zone.' -- John Maxwell*

> *'If you are going through hell, keep going.' -- Winston Churchill*

> *'There are far, far better things ahead than any we leave behind.'-- C.S. Lewis*

> *'The best way out is always through.' -- Robert Frost*

> *'A person often meets his destiny on the road he took to avoid it.' -- Jean de La Fontaine*

> *'Life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all.' -- Helen Keller*

> *'The question is not who is going to let me; it's who is going to stop me.' -- Ayn Rand*

> *'You can, you should, and if you’re brave enough to start, you will' -- Stephen King*

How to design a life?

Mediocrity, as a goal, sucks... as a result, is OK. Lying in death bed and regretting your life is the worst that can happen to you.

> *'My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style' -- Maya Angelou*

> *'Life is not a problem to be solved but a reality to be experienced.' -- Soren Kierkegaard*

<!--
> *'Don’t argue your path with other people. Walk it.' -- Lazy Yogi*

- There’s a fable of a man stuck in a flood. Convinced that God is going to save him, he says no a passing canoe, boat, and helicopter that offer to help. He dies, and in heaven asks God why He didn’t save him. God says, “I sent you a canoe, a boat, and a helicopter!”
That’s why you need to re-evaluate your old dreams to see if new means have come along.
Don’t let the details distract you from your goal.
- To Improve Your Life, You First First Become Uncomfortable
If you want to improve the quality of your life, then start by improving your tolerance for risk and adversity.
Because almost everything that you want is on the other side of the uncomfortable and the scary.
- there's a price for it always. everything is an exchange. you can achieve everything but there is a price. people don't achieve anything because they are not willing to sacrifice. everything is a trade.
- the talent to change your life
- Instead of trying to point yourself in the right direction, admit you have no idea what the right direction is, and try instead to be super sensitive to the winds of change.It's ok to have working hypotheses, even though they may constrain you a bit, because they also motivate you. Especially if they become well enough known that people start to identify them with you. You have to be extra skeptical about things you want to believe, and once a hypothesis starts to be identified with you, it will almost certainly start to be in that category.

Scott’s story is not about movies, or addiction, or creativity, it’s about knowing the right direction to take the next step.

Step 1: FIND OUT WHAT YOU’RE CRAVING:
a) Addiction: I felt powerless. I was addicted to money. More was never enough. Then I left Wall Street. Because they were the supplier.
b) Depletion: Your body needs something. It can be water, a vitamin or mineral or a change. That’s where reinvention comes in.

Fulfillment in Any Endeavor Comes from Variety and Engagement 
Most people continue to chase down their ever elusive “calling”.
You know, that one thing that if they do not do it, they have wasted their entire life and skillsets on trivial activities and distractions.
Allow me to share a little secret with you. This doesn’t exist.

Figure out what you want out of life and figure out how much money you will need to make it happen, then start taking the steps necessary to get there.

search for actionable steps

When you look at your bank account and don’t like what you see, you need to remember that these results were caused by your thoughts. They were caused by your beliefs, your decisions, and your values that were then projected into your reality.

Have a Mission: Every day, whether it’s “be creative today.” Or “go some place you’ve never been” or “talk to ten random strangers”, make a mission. Learn something new. Missions are for people who DO. Mission statements are for people who DON’T.

What do you really want?
- What do the actions of your past suggest is most important to you?
- What desires do you have that don't align with your past behavior.
- What future path does your past behavior suggest rather than your imagination?
- If you don't like these answers, change your existing behavior.
Spend more time doing the things you really want to do.
Getting very clear about what is important allows you to stop caring so much about things that are unimportant.

“It seems so easy because you hang out with yourself all day,” she said. “But it’s so easy to get distracted by who you feel you should be… or who you wish you were. Or who other people expect you to be.”
it’s OK to stop doing things that should make you feel good, but don’t.

Step 1: Do less of what you don’t like doing -- unless it is limiting you
Step 2: Do more of what you like doing
Step 3: Use envy “Envy is painful, but it’s a very helpful emotion for a happy life. It’s a giant red arrow sign standing over someone’s head saying, ‘They've got something you want.’”

DO THE WORK
> *'Work until your idols become your rivals.'*
> *'Work hard in silence. Let your silence be your noise.'*
> *'How much time do you consume vs produce? Are you watching others do things you could be doing if you weren’t watching them.' -- Allen Tucker*

HOWEVER... don't be thirsty: the [journey](#on-gratefulness-and-happiness) will not be enjoyable and people will [envy](#on-outliers) you.

If You Are Not Growing You Are Dying. Life is about constant and never-ending growth. If you want to live your life in such a way that you can take your final breath with a smile on your face, then you must be willing to commit yourself to constant growth. F!ck complacency. I don’t care if you have $10,000,000 in the bank account, a model wife, and all the material possessions this world has to offer, if you are not pushing yourself to grow and expand, you are digging yourself an early grave. Never settle in life, never be content with who you are and what you have achieved. You have to constantly push yourself to do more, achieve more, and, most importantly become more.

### On comfort and risk

*'If you think adventure is dangerous, try routine. It's lethal.' -- Paulo Coelho*

You need to break rules to achieve anything great.  
Breaking rules [frightens](#on-fear-and-excuses) people but comfort is the enemy of achievement. You keep doing what you’re good at to avoid facing the real problems in your life. The size of our life is in direct proportion to how uncomfortable we are willing to be.

> *'I can’t understand why people are frightened of new ideas. I’m frightened of the old ones.' -- John Cage*

> *'When we are tired, we are attacked by ideas we conquered long ago.' -- Friedrich Nietzsche*

> *'If I’d followed all the rules I’d never have gotten anywhere.' -- Marylin Monroe*

> *'Do one thing that scares you everyday.' -- Eleanor Roosevelt*

> *'When the love-of-life line crosses the fear-of-death line, all hell breaks loose.' -- Johannes Rand*

> *'Normality is a paved road: It’s comfortable to walk, but no flowers grow on it.' -- Van Gogh*

> *'There is pleasure in the pathless woods.' -- Lord Byron*

> *'A ship is safe in the harbor but that's not what ships are for.'*

> *'But how can you live and have no story to tell?' -- Fyodor Dostoyevsky*

You can choose courage or you can choose comfort, but you can't choose both.  
Take risk. Big audacious risk. You’ll never get what you want in life without it. Not taking risks is too risky.

If you act average, you're going to be average. If you want to move away from average, you must diverge. And if you want to outperform, you must be different and correct.

> *'Mimicking the herd, invites regression to the mean.' -- Charlie Munger*

Hints:

- The risk of not changing is almost always greater than the risk of changing.  
- Repeating close variations on your usual theme unlocks far more value than you'd expect given minimal novelty value is a surprising result.  
- Choose the hard way. Life is easy, and a soft life makes for soft people. Take a cold shower, join a boxing gym, use the stairs instead of the escalator, go out in nature alone for a week.  
- Being uncomfortable should be “play” for you. Get confort in disconfort.  
- Leap while you’re at the top of the curve, and the next curve builds on the momentum.  
- The discomfort zone is NOT about experiencing pain.  
- The goal of life is not comfort it’s contribution. Society has tried to convince us that the ultimate goal of our lives is to increase our comfort.
But the problem with this philosophy is that no great work ever came from comfort.  
- Reinvention should be an habit not an event. When you control for one set of risks, another simply arises in its place.  
- Risk looks different for everyone.  
- Risk prone is better than risk averse but dont allow to be out of the game. Adventure comes from percieved risk, not peril. Develop a tolerance for risk so that you can build up to the scarier activities later.   

<!--
- This is where margins of safety come in. We build them to reduce the precariousness of chance. Large margins of safety are not always possible. Sometimes they are too expensive. Sometimes they are not available. The fukushima plant could have been designed with a margin of safety to better withstand a tsunami. It wasn’t. Why? Because redundancy is expensive. That’s the trade-off. You are safer, but it costs more money. Sometimes when the stakes are low, we decide the trade-off isn’t worth it. What decisions would you make differently if you were factoring safety margins into your life? To be fair, you can’t put them everywhere. Otherwise, your life might be all margin and no living. To figure out where else you should build margins of safety into your life, think of the times you’ve been terrified and desperate. Those might be good places to start learning from experience and making the most of your second chances.
- It is very popular to be over positive or over negative about it in the media (those people are usually wrong). So keep that in mind when reading those kind of opinions.
- make meetings over playing something. Charlie replaced “let’s grab coffee” with hikes and catch meetings in the park.
- This isn’t a success strategy. This is a WELL-BEING strategy.
- Stability without Stagnation
- FIVE PSYCHOLOGICAL ROADBLOCKS TO EXPLORING OUTSIDE OUR COMFORT ZONES: Authenticity, Likeability, Competence, resentment, morality
- 'And it ought to be remembered that there is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things. Because the innovator has for enemies all those who have done well under the old conditions, and lukewarm defenders in those who may do well under the new. This coolness arises partly from fear of the opponents, who have the laws on their side, and partly from the incredulity of men, who do not readily believe in new things until they have had a long experience of them. Thus it happens that whenever those who are hostile have the opportunity to attack they do it like partisans, whilst the others defend lukewarmly, in such wise that the prince is endangered along with them.' -- machiavelli, chapter 6 of _The Prince_
- risk over safety is the way to pull forward. Risk Leads to Growth and Excitement. You will live a life that is filled with more excitement and fulfillment the more you take intentional risks.

### On habits and systems

*'We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.' -- Will Durant*

Consistency doesn’t come from effort, it comes from systems. Decisions compound. The pathway to freedom is discipline.

> *'Continuous effort, not strength or intelligence, is the key to unlocking our potential.' -- Winston Churchill*

> *'52 approaches in a year is more than most men make in a lifetime. Consistency is everything.'*

> *'Volume usually outpaces intensity. You can’t just put in a huge effort a few times.' -- Allen Tucker*

> *'First we make our habits, then our habits make us.' -- Charles C. Nobel*

> *'Hard choices, easy life. Easy choices, hard life.' -- Jerzy Gregorek*

> *'Habit is the intersection of knowledge (what to do), skill (how to do), and desire (want to do).' -- Stephen Covey*

How to create new habits?

- Small steps beat big dreams: start very small, The smaller the change you try to make to your life, the more likely you’ll actually make it. Shrink how long you’ll do something until you no longer feel resistance to it. This is a great way to integrate new habits into your life. “Could I meditate for 15 minutes? No, I feel resistance, I’m not gonna do it. Okay, what about 10? Still too long. Okay, five? Huh, I don’t feel resistance to that. I feel like I can sit for five.” Boom. Take micro/nano steps at a time. Minimize interruptions
- Anticipate obstacles to new habits. When you integrate new habits into your life, make sure you look out on the horizon for any obstacles or commitments that might get in the way of you forming new habits.  
- Get accountable: Make bad habits more expensive by making a pact with someone to introduce financial penalties for habits that are bad for you both. This helps you focus on the costs of your bad habits, instead of their rewards.  
- Reward yourself. Adopting new behaviors and habits is difficult, but providing yourself with rewards for following through with new behaviors has been shown to help you solidify new habits. Reward yourself to solidify new habits.  
- Focus on the costs of bad habits.

Hints on good habits:

- Cultivate high leverage habits: [meditate](#on-meditation), spend time outside, exercise, [rest](#on-health), travel, learn useful skills (making challenge = skill), read, journal, listen music, create, network and make friends, spending time w/ friends & family, massaging, remember to be grateful, lower expectations, forgiving yourself, self awareness, plan and goals (productive visualization), eat mindfully (e.g. water, blueberries, green tea, avocados, leafy green vegetables, fatty fish, water, dark chocolate, flax seeds and nuts), multitasking / focus / do less.  sleep / nap , smile, use colors  
- Avoid low leverage habits: social media, news, pointless notifications, smartphones (they are the new cigarettes), owning a TV, working long hours, bad relationships, judging, control of petty stuff, perfectionism..  
- Mental checklist of positive habits.

Shut off all work and electronics at least 2 hours before you want to go to sleep, sit down with a pen and a notepad and write down everything that you need to achieve the following day in order of importance.

Effort and reward have a linear relationship when the action is mindless and simple. Effort and reward have a diminishing returns relationship when the action is complex and multivariate. But when the action becomes purely psychological—an experience that exists solely within our own consciousness—the relationship between effort and reward becomes inverted. desiring a positive experience is itself a negative experience; accepting a negative experience is a positive experience.

Here are a few snippets from my own annual review:
GOOD:
Health & Fitness: I was consistent with my training regimen and I’m in the best shape of my life. I ride my bike daily and now follow a diet that is heavy in healthy fruits and vegetables and very low in meat (still love steak!). I’ve also completed my third year of daily cold showers.
Business & Career: 2017 was a record year for me. My company broke 7-figures, I expanded my team to 12 highly talented people, my podcast has grown to 4.5 million downloads and my books and courses are selling more than ever before.
Finances: This has been my best year financially, I no longer have to worry about bills or look at my bank account when I want to buy something. However, I keep a minimalist approach to my life so I rarely spend money on “things” and instead invest in my team, friends, and family.
Relationships: I dramatically improved my networking and social circle in 2017 and have enjoyed a great romantic relationship. I’m learning a lot, growing, and getting outside of my comfort zone on a daily basis.
Personal Growth: In 2017, I gained massive clarity on who I am and what I want out of life. I no longer suffer from “Guru” worship and have found a way to tailor personal growth to my life in a way that brings me more joy and fulfillment. (Goodbye “Crush it work 18 hours a day!” mentality)
BAD:
Health & Fitness: The main issue with my health and fitness in 2017 was chronic pelvic and knee pain which reduces overall quality of life. And, as I’ve expanded my network and social circle, I’ve allowed my social drinking to increase in the past few months.
Business & Career: Even though 2017 was a great year, Knowledge for Men did experience some growing pains. Early in the year, I didn’t focus heavily enough on creating systems to successfully scale the coaching side of my business and ended up overextending myself as a result. I also didn’t focus on scalable assets like books and online courses. Also an employee of mine flooded my office by accident which cost me nearly $25k in damages to the structure of the building.
Finances: Although I made plenty of money in 2017, I didn’t do very well investing that money into long-term cash flow producing assets. I’ve also struggled to keep up with taxes as my income has increased.
Relationships: Although my relationship is great, I’m still working on improving my communication with my partner so that I can show up as authentically and honestly as possible. I’ve also struggled to keep up with old friends while expanding my social circle.
Personal Growth: 2017 was the first year in nearly a decade where I didn’t do much reading. I used to read 2-3 books a month and this year I read maybe 5 books total. I also stayed very close to San Diego for the entire year and didn’t travel the way that I wanted too.

Why You Should Record Your Conversations with Strangers

99. See your life as a series of “hotspots.” Every day you invest your time, energy, and attention into seven hotspots: mind, body, emotions, career, finances, relationships, and fun. See your hotspots as a portfolio to make sure you don’t overinvest in some areas and underinvest in others.

*'To improve is to change; to be perfect is to change often.' -- Winston Churchill*

Most problems can be solved by graded exposure over time. Make the mind tougher by exposing it to adversity.

So adventure is more than just grist for future storytelling — it’s a way to learn optimally. And like anything that promotes self-improvement, it’s not always a comfortable process. “We need to be willing to grow,” says Jon. “We need to be willing to be uncomfortable.”

1. Seek knowledge. Knowledge and Courage are the elements of Greatness. Wisdom and strength, eyes and hands. Knowledge without courage is sterile. -- Balthasar Gracian

When I asked him what separated his student from the other people he’d mentored Russel’s answer was simple.
“He’s willing to listen to people who are smarter than he is and he has a tremendous hustle and drive.”

Project-based learning is not a superior new idea. Project-based learning is the most inefficient form of learning that still works.
learning concepts is much more important than learning applications

People often ask me what’s the best language to learn to study software design. I ask them what’s the best instrument to learn to study music theory. Everyone answers piano. In piano, you can see the chords in a way that you can’t in, say, trombone. We see something similar in other domains. In The Art of Learning, Josh Waitzkin recounts how, unlike others, he started studying chess at the fundamentals, in situations with few pieces on the board. He ultimately beat competitors who studied many times harder. In The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses, Jesse Schell advocates looking past modern video games and instead studying the concepts in board games, dice games, playground games.

The second big argument for project-based learning is that it more closely resembles what students will actually do on the job. This, in turn, is based on the idea that the best way to practice an activity is to do it.
you isolate subskills and drill them

You can spend hundreds of hours practicing a piece using too many muscles on every key press. If your body awareness isn’t great, you might not find out until your hand cramps up right before your performance. A couple seconds to catch that mistake, a couple minutes to tell you a story of that happening to others, and the piano teacher’s just saved you months. -> value of a coach\

None of her “13 Things” can be taught in school. School teaches facts. And it teaches you to memorize facts. And it punishes you if you forget the facts. But facts won’t help you survive the tragedies of life. I wish school had taught me how to really live. How to be healthy. How to survive the hardest relationships. How to be creative every day. How to surrender to the things I can’t control.

Without a demonstrably immense superiority in skill over the novice, there can be no true experts, only laypeople with imposing credentials.

'The chess grand master considers no more moves than does the expert; he just knows which ones to look at.' -- Robyn Dawes
The better players did not examine more possibilities, only better ones — just as Capablanca had claimed.
Yet in both cases, the expert relies not so much on an intrinsically stronger power of analysis as on a store of structured knowledge.

Ericsson argues that what matters is not experience per se but “effortful study,” which entails continually tackling challenges that lie just beyond one’s competence. (out of confort zone)!!

The very best old-time masters were considerably
stronger but still well below the level of today’s leaders.
Then again, Capablanca and his contemporaries had neither
computers nor game databases. They had to work things out
for themselves, as did Bach, Mozart and Beethoven, and if they
fall below today’s masters in technique, they tower above them
in creative power. The same comparison can be made between
Newton and the typical newly minted Ph.D. in physics.

laziness
lack of concern
I’d much rather do something easier instead (Avoiding discomfort)

I’m just not in the mood to do this right now (Emotional state)
too tired
too hungry
too stressed
I’ve done everything I could, and still no progress has been made (Action illusion)
Tactics for remedy

Home run

Set (realistic) goals and (suitable) rewards. Each time you hit a goal, you earn the reward. Select a time to review your progress and adjust your targets accordingly.

- Be good to yourself
- Imagine a conversation between ‘you today’ and ‘you tomorrow’… what would he have to say?

Set creative punishments
Make the consequences of inaction so unbearable that you have no choice but to get busy now. You could write a check to someone or something you really dislike. Give the check to a friend with strict instructions to mail the check if you do not achieve your goal.
Going public with a goal increases your support and accountability. Ask for support, but don’t kid yourself that support equals progress.

I’m not going to share with you that I don’t know what I’m talking about.’ See, I ask a lot of questions…I don’t allow my pride or ego to get in the way, because strength starts at the base. You’ve got to let the veil down. You’ve got to be transparent. You’ve got to be vulnerable. That’s why I’ve been in mastermind groups for twenty years. Without those guys, I don’t know where I would be. These guys have different lenses. They have different filters.
“You only have one life experience. You can only see things one way. No matter how hard you try, you’ve only got one filter and one life experience by which to determine. But when you surround yourself with people that don’t have anything to gain or lose -- non-biased people -- they have different life experiences. They have different filters. They can say, ‘You know what? I’ve done that before and life teaches me this.’ Or, ‘I’ve done that before and it sounds good in the textbook, but in reality, this is the way.’
I can maybe look foolish or silly in that group, but it protects me from looking silly and foolish out in the world.

2. To Lead a Balanced and Healthy Life You Need to Ask the Right Questions
Tony Robbins says that the quality of your life is based on the quality of the questions that you ask yourself.
If you are facing health struggles, you need to ask yourself these three questions to truly uncover the root cause of the issues in your life.
1) What Are You Holding On To?What happened in your life that you are still angry, depressed, or frustrated with? What are you really holding onto that is holding you back.
2) What is Life trying to Teach You?How can you reframe the thing that you are holding onto into something good? What is life trying to teach you through that struggle.
3) How Can I Move On?What steps do you need to take to move on with your life? Who do you need to forgive, what needs to be said, who needs to be removed from your life?

Write advice to yourself or other people. Review it regularly. Edit it. Refine it. It worked for Marcus Aurelius and it worked for Bruce Lee.
I’ve started a list of advice or things I know. Perhaps things I believe I know. Some of these are lessons I’ve learned the hard way, others are lessons I’ve observed in others. This process reminds us of what’s most important and helps us to avoid making the same mistakes in the future. I will edit and add to this over time. Try making your own list and I think it will be worth your time.

If you’re not getting better today, you’re getting worse.”

on learning:
1. Teachers are viewed as saviors when materials are actually the determining factor.
2. Classes move as slowly as the slowest student.
beginner, intermediate, and advanced
there are at least 20 different skill levels.
3-Conversation can be learned but not taught.
Somewhat like riding a bike, though unfortunately not as permanent, language fluency is more dependent on practicing the right things than learning the right things. The rules (grammar) can be learned through materials and classes, but the necessary tools (vocabulary and idiomatic usage) will come from independent study and practice in a native environment.
Separate grammar from conversation practice. I recommend choosing one school for grammar and several native books or comics to identify sticking points, which are then discussed in one-one-one language exchanges, where your partner provides examples of usage and does not explain rules.
4. Teachers are often prescriptive instead of descriptive.
teachers should give you tricks.
In conclusion—the learner is the problem (what?)
Classes are easily used to infinitely postpone making the thousands of mistakes necessary to achieve fluency. 

Don’t waste time on more than learning more than a handful of conjugations for primarily first-person singular (I) and second-person singular (you) in the past, present, and future tenses, along with common phrases that illustrate them. Throw in a few auxilaries (to want to V, to need to V, to like to V, etc.)

Make it your goal to screw up as often as possible in uncontrolled environments. Explicitly ask friends to correct you and reward them with thanks and praise when they catch you spouting nonsense, particularly the small understandable mistakes. 

I was able to pass the Certificado de Espanol Avanzado, the most diffucult Spanish certification test in South America, in eight weeks, which is said to require near-native fluency and years of immersion. How? By following the above fixes and making more mistakes in eight weeks than most make in eight years.

!!!!!It is easier, and much more time-efficient, to catch up versus keep up.!!!!!

I began reactivation of irretrievable German just over a week ago and can already hold a decent conversation. This is not a testament to my ability, but to the efficacy of a process that begins with massive passive exposure and avoids time-consuming review from square one:

1. Days 1-7: German films with English subtitles for at least two hours each evening for one week.
2. Days 3+: 10-20 pages of dialogue-rich manga (Japanese comics, here translated into German, that can be ordered in most languages from comic stores in your target country) for 30 minutes each morning and prior to bed. I’m a big fan of One Piece.
3. On the plane: Read a phrasebook in its entirety for active recall practice of common phrases (45 minutes of study alternated with 15 minutes of rest — this takes advantage of what is called the “primacy and recency” effect).
4. Upon arrival: Continue with manga and grammar reference checks as needed, using an electronic dictionary to reactivate vocabulary from conversation that is familiar but not understood.
5. Weeks 2-3: Thirty to sixty Vis-Ed flashcards daily. This seems like a lot, but most will have been covered in steps 1-3 using active recall (English to German). Vis-Ed compiles its sets of flashcards from word frequency lists and includes sample phrases for usage. I begin flashcards after three or four days in-country.

!!! Before you invest (or waste) hundreds and thousands of hours on a language, you should deconstruct it. !!!
Consider a new language like a new sport. analogy. advantages and train

The apple is red.
It is John’s apple.
I give John the apple. - I give John the apple.
We give him the apple.
He gives it to John.
She gives it to him.

I want to give it to her.

learn conjugations for “helping” verbs like “to want,” “to need,” “to have to,” “should,” etc. In Spanish and many others, this allows you to express yourself with “I need/want/must/should” + the infinite of any verb. Learning the variations of a half dozen verbs gives you access to all verbs. This doesn’t help when someone else is speaking, but it does help get the training wheels off self-expression as quickly as possible.

### On self awareness

*'No persons are more frequently wrong, than those who will not admit they are wrong.' -- François de La Rochefoucauld*

Self awareness is the ability to pause your mind.

Self awareness reduces the gap between who we are and who we think we are.   
Do you know anyone who doesn’t have any blind spots? Then why would you be any different?

> *'Weeds are flowers too, once you get to know them.' -- A.A. Milne*

How to grow self awareness?

- Professionals ask questions. Amateurs make statements. Closed-minded people focus more on being understood than on understanding others. They don’t want their ideas challenged and are typically frustrated that they can’t get the other person to agree with them. Open-minded people are more curious about why there is disagreement and understand that there is always the possibility that they might be biased and that it’s worth the little bit of time it takes to [listen](/chapter_2_groups.md#on-communication) the other person’s views.

If we cut ourselves off from the full scope of history because it makes us uncomfortable, or doesn’t fit with the cultural narrative in which we live, we reduce our ability to learn from the past and apply those lessons to the situations we are facing today.
We need to accept that people can do great things while still having flaws. Our heroes don’tr have to be perfect, and we can learn just as much from their imperfections as from their achievements.

When you don’t create things, you become defined by your tastes rather than ability. Your tastes only narrow & exclude people. So create.

> *'Body language affects your psychology, your mood, and even your hormonal balance.'*

> *'Action cures everything. Plain and simple.'*

What is the cause of stress?

Stress is caused by under-stimulation or over-stimulation (worrying about the [past](#on-past) or the [future](#on-future)).  The more relaxed you are, the better you are at everything.

> *'Under-stimulation = boredom   
right amount of stress = hustling (stretching comfort zone)   
over-stimulation = anxiety'*

> *'If you are depressed you are living in the past.   
If you are anxious you are living in the future.   
If you are at peace you are living in the present.' -- Lao Tzu*

<!-- ligar com #on-control -->

> *'Anxiety is linked with our wired out evolutionarily for a [need of control](#on-control). Anxiety is not planning, anxiety is to go on continuously over any kind of scenario. Past is only in your head. What's important is present and future. We don't control anything, at most we influence some stuff.'*

What is depression?

Depression is the lack of self-expression. Anxiety and depression are symptoms, not diseases. If you feel powerless/being dominated you will be chronically stressed.

> *'Anxiety creates hypersensitivity.'*  
> *'Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom.' -- Søren Kierkegaard*  
> *'Exercise diminishes need of control. people burn extra calories through anxiety.'*

> *'Stress is caused by giving a fuck. If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it; and this you have the power to revoke at any moment. Worry is a misuse of the imagination.'*

> *'Boredom is a soul sucker. The unfed mind devours itself.'*  
> *'Stressed out by being under estimulated, people will create stresses trying to estimulate themselves.'*

> *'Nothing is gained by worrying about «not knowing»'*

> *'Financial health is just as important as physical health. Nothing feels as good as having a «fuck you» fund.'*

> *'The food you eat can either be the safest and most powerful form of medicine or the slowest form of poison.' -- Ann Wigmore*

How to fight depression?

Best antidepressant is knowing we matter to others. Exercise and starving a close second.

### On fear, anger and excuses

*'We can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark; the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light.' -- Plato*

Fear is paralyzing. If you view everything through the lens of fear, then you tend to stay in retreat mode.

How to overcome it?

- Replace fear of unknown with curiosity.  
- Reframe fear as «false evidence appearing real».  
- The antidote to fear is not courage is aceptance. You'll never have fear when you give more value to lessons than successes.  
- Break down your fears until you figure out the truth.

> *'We fear things in proportion to our ignorance of them.' -- Christian Nestell Bovee*

> *'Expose yourself to your deepest fear; after that, fear has no power, and the fear of freedom shrinks and vanishes. You are free. -- Jim Morrison*

Anger and excuses are fear clothed. All excuses are refutable. You'll never be as young as you are today and you cannot use your personality type as an excuse. The best years of your life are the ones in which you decide your problems are your own. You do not blame them on your mother, the ecology, or the president. You realize that you control your own destiny. Living reality requires less energy than victim constiousness. Escaping reality sucks your energy.

> *'Hatred is born of ignorance. Fear is its father, and isolation is its mother.' -- Christian Picciolini*

> *'It’s not the mountain we conquer but ourselves.' -- Sir Edmund Hillary*

> *'Behaviors are driven by fear. To change behaviors focus on fear, not on the behavior itself.'*

Hints on courage:

> *'Tolerance of intolerance is cowardice.' -- Ayaan Hirsi Ali*

> *'Evil will prevail if good men stand back and do nothing.'*

<!--
> *'Don’t be afraid to be alone. Don’t be afraid to be committed. Fear is the most limiting quality a person has.' -- Michelangelo*
age is a mindset
> *'Set aside a certain number of days, during which you shall be content with the scantiest and cheapest fare, with course and rough dress, saying to yourself the while: “Is this the condition that I feared?' -- Seneca*  
> *'Named must your fear be before banish it you can.' -- Yoda*
> *'You always have two choices: your commitment versus your fear.' -- Sammy Davis Jr.*
> *'The things we fear the most have already happened to us.'*
> *'If you hate a person, you hate something in him that is part of yourself. What isn't part of ourselves doesn't disturb us.' -- Hermann Hesse*

- Conquering Fear = Defining Fear: define your fears not your goals
- I do an exercise called “fear-setting” at least once a quarter, often once a month. It is the most powerful exercise I do.
“Whenever I feel anxious in general or about something specific, I take a piece of paper and lay it out in landscape and create three columns. In the first column on the far left, I write at the top, “What are all the worst things that could happen, however absurd?” In the middle column I write, “What could I do to mitigate the horrible things from happening?” and in the far right column I write, “What could I do to get back to where I am now, if these things happen?” Tim calls this exercise “Fear-Setting” and he uses it frequently.

### On shame

*'Once you’ve accepted your flaws, no one can use them against you.' -- Tyrion*

You are not you think you are: *you are what you hide*. Usually the things you hate most about yourself are the things you hide from the rest of the world.
What I’m saying is, you gotta share that shit in order to heal it. Speaking openly about an imperfection is a sign of strength, not a weakness.

<!--
You can hide the ugly parts, but you can't make them disappear.
-->

> *'Imperfections are attractive when their owners are happy with them.' -- Augusten Burroughs*

> *'It takes more courage to reveal your insecurities than to hide them.' -- Alex Karras*

> *'Being entirely honest with oneself is an important exercise.' -- Sigmund Freud*

> *'What you fear you attract; what you resist, you make it bigger.'*

> *'Just get out of the room.' -- Robert Glover*

> *'Shame corrodes the very part of us that believes we are capable of change.' -- Brene Brown*

> *'Nobody feels love when they feel shame.' -- John Townsend*

How shame is created?

When you try to fix something about yourself, you automatically create shame, because you’re saying this thing that’s true about myself is wrong – it is a problem, there is something wrong with me, I am broken.

### On mistakes and failure

*'Experience is merely the name men gave to their mistakes.' -- Oscar Wilde*

Fail fast and bounce back quickly by being [grateful](#on-gratitude-and-humbleness):  
Sometimes you win, sometimes you learn. Accept failure as part of the process. Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new.

Making mistakes is better than faking perfections. The more you fail, the more you learn.

> *'The greatest mistake you can make in life is to continually be afraid you will make one.' -- Elbert Hubbard*

> *'A scar is not an injury. A scar is an healing. After an injury, a scar is what makes you whole.' -- China Mieville*

> *'Repeated failure will toughen your spirit and show you with absolute clarity how things must be done.'*

> *'Failure is the condiment that gives success its flavor.' -- Truman Capote*

> *'Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.' -- 1 Thessalonians 5:21*

> *'When you don't know something you will pay for it. That's the stupidity tax.'*

> *'Good judgment comes from experience. Experience comes from bad judgment'. -- Jim Horning*

> *'Calling it an experiment gives you permission to fail.' -- A.J. Jacobs*

> *'You’re going to make mistakes in life. It’s what you do after the mistakes that counts.' -- Brandi Chastain*

> *'A life spent making mistakes is not only more honourable, but more useful, than a life spent doing nothing.' -- George Bernard Shaw*

> *'It's not the load that breaks you down, it's the way you carry it.' -- Lou Holtz*

Be gentle first with yourself. You are more than your mistakes. Your past mistakes are meant to guide you, not to define you.

> *'It’s not just other people we need to forgive. Sometimes we need to forgive ourselves.' -- Mitch Albom*

Suffering is a temporary but essential part of life.

> *'Your pain, is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding.' -- Kahil Gibran, The Prophet*

> *'Out of suffering have emerged the strongest souls; the most massive characters are seared with scars.' -- Kahlil Gibran*

<!--
What are we afraid of? We’re afraid of growth. We’re terrified of exposure. Remember, nothing scares the crap out of us more than advancing, because to advance is to move from the known to the unknown.

- Failure is only failure if you don’t learn from it, if you don’t grow from it, and if you don’t reframe it so that you see each failure as a valuable teacher, educating you about how to achieve your dreams.
- failures are flip-sides of our strengths, the opposite is true also. you fail by the same reasons that you sometimes you will succeed
- When I want someone to choose me, when I want an event to be different, when I want a life circumstance to change, I can only surrender to it. I can’t control it. Surrender is ACTIVE. It teams you up with the strongest part of yourself. Surrender is PEACEFUL. It lets anxiety take a break. “Anxiety, stop trying to control”.
- Don’t ever regret anything because regretting means wanting to forget every moment. Every moment is what makes you who you are today, every moment spent in regret is a moment wasted. Don’t waste your moments in life, you never know when you’ll stop waking up.

- The philosopher Alain de Botton has written about this in his book Status Anxiety. In centuries past, he says, people knew where they fit into the social order. If you were born a peasant, you knew you were a peasant. If you were born a lord, you knew you were a lord. There was no mobility or opportunity, and so there was no stress about getting ahead. You weren’t responsible for your birthright, so you accepted it and moved on.
But in a meritocratic society, something changes. In a meritocracy, if you’re poor, or you gain success and then lose it, it’s not an accident. It’s worse. It’s your fault. You’re the failure. You’re the one who lost everything. And this causes people to live shackled with a constant fear of inadequacy; all the world’s hustle and bustle motivated by a baseline status anxiety.
De Botton doesn’t argue that feudal societies or poor societies were somehow better. He simply makes the point that when a society goes from feudal and destitute to meritocratic and wealthy, the price its people pay for that increased standard of living and social mobility is an increase in stress and anxiety.
After all, the greater the opportunity one has, the greater the anxiety of somehow squandering it. Thus, we stress: we need to make better grades, to get a better job, to date more attractive people, to have cooler hobbies, to make more friends, to be more liked and more popular. Simply being content with what we have isn’t good enough anymore. In fact, for some it’s tantamount to giving up.

- Avoiding Anxiety Leads to More Anxiety. While we’re busy trying to avoid the feeling of anxiety, we begin to restrict our life more and more.
Social Anxiety is never the problem, but trying to avoid social anxiety is. Social Anxiety Buster #1: Fake It ‘Til You Make It. Social Anxiety Buster #2: Be Present and Listen. Social Anxiety Buster #3: Mind Your Body Language

- every difficulty carries with it a corresponding opportunity of equal size.
- I had a scarcity mindset = pessimism, about life and zero confidence

Failure is necessary to be successful in life. There’s a big difference between quitting and failure.

Thinking about it makes it worse. Writing about it makes it better.

### On confidence and validation

*'Believe you can, and you’re halfway there.'*

If you say it with confidence, you are who you say you are. You're only as good as your next speech.

Don’t wait for someone to tell you that you are special. You should look at rejection as a tool that reveals incompatibility instead of evidence of your unworthiness or inadequateness. Let go of your ego and your need for validation. If the universe didn't need you, you wouldn't be here. 

> *'Having a low opinion of yourself is not modesty. It’s self-destruction.' -- Bobby Sommer*

> *'Value yourself. The only people who appreciate a doormat are people with dirty shoes.' -- Leo Buscaglia*

> *'The problem with the world is that the intelligent people are full of doubts while the stupid ones are full of confidence.' -- Charles Bukowski*

[Mastery](#on-mastery) and [core values](#on-identity) are good sources of confidence.  
In the meanwhile any source is good. Don't stop till you get it.

> *'If you don't believe in yourself. Believe in me who believes in you.'*

> *'Fake it till you make it.'*

Other confidence «movers»:

- When you break an agreement that you make with yourself, your selfestime plummets: don't do it or renegociate it.  
- Confidence: state + mastery. impress yourself.  
- Confidence is a result, not a requirement.  
- Presence is confidence without arrogance, grounded enthusiasm and comfortable behavior. Authenticity can't be faked.  
- Confidence relies on pride. pursue authentic pride.  
- HARD WORK = CONFIDENCE

<a id="on-arrogance"></a>HOWEVER... know the frontier between confidence and arrogance.

> *'Confidence is not walking into a room thinking you are better than everyone, it's walking in not having to compare yourself with anyone at all.'*

> *'Ego is the enemy. People say that you can't fly and then you flew. Then you think you are God.'*

> *'Arrogance is a smokescreen for insecurity.' -- Amy Cuddy*

> *'Don't be so humble - you are not that great.' -- Golda Meir*

<!--
Self-worth is how you feel about the negative aspects of yourself. The people who truly have self-worth are humble. They don’t think they’re something special. They know what they are and what they aren’t, and they’re okay with it.

Hopelessness is the root of anxiety, mental illness, and depression. It is the source of all misery and the cause of all addiction. -- m manson

It’s really hard to have self-esteem. Everyone wants to take it from us. A boss, a teacher, a parent, a friend, a lover. Why Self-Compassion Works Better Than Self-Esteem: Boosting your ego won’t make you feel better. Instead, try talking to yourself like you would your best friend.

> *'With a strong enough «why», you can overcome any «how».' -- Tony Robbins*
“There was a gun to my head. The gun was, I didn’t want to be in an assisted living home, watching TV all day, waiting to die.
“Every day I wake up with that gun to my head. Every day I live.”

- Uncovering Fear Disguised as Optimism
- hero and coward feel the same fear but their answers to it are different.
- You don’t have to prove anything to anybody, including yourself.

- Seek Validation from Yourself and Yourself Only, specially men. The problem is that men stop valuing themselves and their own opinions and beliefs and start valuing only the approval and validation of women.

- The greatest demonstration of power and security is to actually make oneself defenseless, to become as comfortable with one’s weaknesses as possible.
When accompanied by authenticity and personal accountability, vulnerability is almost always an extremely attractive behavior. When it’s not attractive, then it signals legitimate incompatibility. All in all, it makes your dating life 1,000 times easier and more fun to navigate.

> *'Whenever I climb I am followed by a dog called ‘Ego’.' -- Friedrich Nietzsche*

- Trauma is a tattoo on the soul. Tattoos and body piercings, are disguises, masks, to compensate for inadequacies, physical & mental insecurities. I’ve never met anyone yet covered in tattoos who isn’t profoundly insecure.
- analogy: confidence is like a building

Building confidence takes time and it takes effort; there are no shortcuts. To help you build confidence, you need three things: the right attitude (to believe in yourself), knowledge and experience.
	
> *'I think it is important to understand how much space you take up in the world indicates to others and yourself how confident you feel.'*
If you can show up in the world as a man who is confident in who he is and what he believes and maintain a strong congruence in your thoughts, words, and deeds, then the sky is the limit.

How to Enter a Room So People Take Notice
1. Do a Body Check at the Door: Stand tall, put a smile on your face, and roll your shoulders back and down so your hands are at your sides and not in your pockets.
2. Don’t Look Away! Eye contact builds trust.
3. dont hide yourself.
4. dont wait to start talking. a group or a double might be an easy place to start.
5. Keep it simple. Remember, to be interesting, you’ve got to be interested.
I do my best to always pay attention to how I am presenting myself to others everywhere I go. I do a body check every time I walk into a room and make sure to keep a high value mindset. I feel that I am a better listener now and I pay close attention to low value behaviors that try to creep back into my life. My conversations are better. People see me as a confident person and as someone they can talk to. The increased enjoyment of my life and my relationships are priceless and the investment I made in myself has already financially paid itself back several times.

> *'Dress for the job you want, not for the one you have.'*

Someone else’s strengths don’t make you look bad, but being jealous and insecure does.
> *'Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength, while loving someone deeply gives you courage.' -- Lao Tzu* 

9. Entitlement comes in two forms.
Form one: I’m better than everybody and therefore deserve special treatment.
Form two: I’m worse than everybody and therefore deserve special treatment.
They’re both forms of narcissism (because they’re both about me me me), and both are pretty much never true. Which one do you usually fall into?

### On limits, resistance and motivation

*'The only person standing in your way is you.' -- Black Swan*

Your limits are where are your [fears](#on-fear-anger-and-excuses).  

Impostor syndrome: your beliefs determine your reality. Nothing can sabotage you more quickly and more completely than limiting beliefs.  People underestimate their possibilities. We live in a society where the greatest lies that are told are the ones that we tell ourself. There are few actual rules. The police aren't coming for you. No one is watching you. Do what you want.

> *'To define is to limit.' -- Oscar Wilde*

However your level of success will seldom exceed your level of personal development.

> *'We don’t rise to the level of our expectations, we fall to the level of our training.' -- Archilochus*

How to break through your plateaus?

- On a plateau take a step back.  
- Break down your dreams/goals into achievable steps.

<!--
- Often our productivity struggles are caused not by a lack of efficiency, but a lack of motivation. - what does motivate you? a pica!

- The biggest set back I see around me is limiting beliefs. I see a lot of people telling themselves old stories that keep them stuck in patterns that aren’t serving them. I really enjoy sharing my experiences to show others what is possible. I think the biggest compliment I can ever receive is that I inspired someone, if I’ve done that for even one person, my job is complete. Nothing I’ve done in my career is out of reach to the average person, you’ve just got to believe.

### On perfectionism

*'The perfect is the enemy of the good.' -- Voltaire*

*'One of the counterintuitive things that I've learned is that procrastination is often a side-effect of perfectionism.' -- bane_HN*

Strive for excellence, not for perfection. From good enough you can derive success.  
Try to see yourself as a doist, not a perfectionist. This is liberating.

> *'Think of your life merely as a long sequence of actions and decisions. If you’re like most people, many of these actions and decisions are sub-optimal. And what most of us mean when we say we’d like to “change” ourselves is simply that we’d like to make slightly more optimal actions and decisions. Keep your “self” out of your decisions, because most likely, it’s not about “you”. Simply ask yourself, “Is this a good thing to do?” Yes? Then go do it.' -- Mark Manson*

> *'Perfectionism doesn’t make you feel perfect; it makes you feel inadequate.' -- Maria Shriver*

> *'No one in the brief history of computing has ever written a piece of perfect software. It’s unlikely that you’ll be the first.' -- Andy Hunt*

> *'The important work of moving the world forward does not wait to be done by perfect men.' -- George Eliot*

What is perfectionism?

> *'Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.' -- Antoine de Saint-Exupéry*
