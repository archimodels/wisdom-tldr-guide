# 2.1 - On interaction

### On networking

Don't isolate yourself. Who you know and whether they like you will determine what opportunities you get.

> *'To develop your intellectual powers at the expense of the social is to retard your own progress to mastery.'*

> *'Do not build fortresses to protect yourself: isolation is dangerous.'  
'Play the perfect courtier.' -- Robert Greene (4th and 24th law of power)*

> *'The purpose of high education is first and foremost to meet people and build relationships.'*

> *'We don’t like people that see us in a way that doesn’t resonate with how we see ourselves — even if they see us better than we see ourselves.'*

How to network?

Adding value is everything. Find out what people actually want and give it to them.  
People want to form relationships with those who seem like they’ll give more (or at least as much) than they take.

> *'You'll start to live when you can live outside yourself. Being in the moment instead of being in your head.'*

> *'Social inadequacy AKA creepiness is based on unpredictability.'*

> *'Build rapport, cut the BS. Speak what's in your mind, sometimes it backfires, but be real'*

> *'If people forget it wasn't a good network anyway'*

> *'The importance of enthusiasm; the importance of connecting people; expect magic in any encounter'*

How to prepare an elevator pitch?

Personal branding means you are a liar. Truth is a better way to talk about ourselves.
I’ve realized that there’s one story that’s actually pretty dangerous: the Story We Tell About Ourselves to Other People.
The Seduction of Self-Mythology
What a good story does, really, is condense a massive amount of information into a consumable and shareable form.
Its primary purpose isn’t accuracy, but entertainment; and when it is accurate, it’s only accurate to the extent that the story requires in order to remain relevant. As a result, most stories gloss over the banal and nonessential, and instead focus on the Most Interesting Parts (or MIPs, because who doesn’t love a useless acronym?) — the stuff that will keep your audience engaged.
Hitchcock said that cinema is just life with the boring parts cut out. You could say the same thing about the stories we tell about ourselves.
When it comes to the story of our own lives, we’re more like novelists, not journalists. We’re not reading from our confessional journals, but recounting a polished story we’ve rehearsed over years.
So a bio becomes a highlight reel of pedigree and accomplishments.
They’d fail to accomplish our goal with a good story, which is to impress, to attract, to reassure, to sell.
Because most of the stories we hear about people’s success are nothing more than clever myth-making: a way of reconfiguring their past as they wish to remember it, shaping it into a compelling and effective narrative, and weaponizing it into a personal propaganda tool.
That story might be Rags to Riches, Rising from the Ashes, One Yes after a Thousand Nos, Crazy Till I Wasn’t, or any one of the familiar narratives we’ve heard from our heroes
We talk about authenticity here at AoC as a subtractive process, a quality you achieve not by adding things to yourself, but by subtracting the things that get in the way.

If you can show up in the world as a man who is confident in who he is and what he believes and maintain a strong congruence in your thoughts, words, and deeds, then the sky is the limit.

How to Enter a Room So People Take Notice
1. Do a Body Check at the Door: Stand tall, put a smile on your face, and roll your shoulders back and down so your hands are at your sides and not in your pockets.
2. Don’t Look Away! Eye contact builds trust.
3. dont hide yourself.
4. dont wait to start talking. a groou or a double might be an easy place to start.
5. Keep it simple. Remember, to be interesting, you’ve got to be interested.

Your personality type is not an excuse to not network.
introvert is not shyness.
most things are not binary. Imagine a introvertness scale from 1 to 7.
It's hard to pass from a 2 to 7 but you can pass from 2 to a 3 or 4.

How to taylor a network?

> *'Networking types: advocates a, boomerang b, celebrities c, drainers d  
shark, dolphin, drowner'*

> *'community of experts (that give you good answers)
critical colleagues (10 people that make a big difference in your immediate career) - boss / boss's boss'*

> *'expand from too dense networks'*

while drumming up new connections by networking is important, it’s even more important to remember and recognize your connections that already exist. buzz marketing
unlocking dormant ties

### On communication

Speak less and listen more: be humble.  
Listening is powerful.

> *'Listen to many, speak to a few.' -- William Shakespeare*

> *'People don’t listen, they just wait for their turn to talk.' -- Chuck Palahniuk*

> *'Listen to predict a collapse.'*

> *'Arguing as you're right. Listening as you're wrong.'*

How talk to people?  
Smile, don't ramble, look for external catalysts as hints for stories and questions, talk about your passions instead of accomplishments, don't be stubborn and listen.

> *'Get better asking questions. They are more important than answers.'*

> *'Talk about your passions instead of your accomplishments (aka bragging), transform it in a story.'*

> *'Storytelling is about the details.'*

> *'On improvisation is more productive to say «yes and» instead of «yes but». Get rid of ego and add value. Don't judge.'*

> *'Know how to lead a conversation and how to go with the conversational flow. Get out of your head and become more situationally aware, always looking for external catalysts.'*

> *'You don't always have to get the last word. Make your point and leave it that way. Let go.'*

<!--
The best conversationalists are the best listeners.
What do you do when you run out of things to say in a conversation?
Learn how to lessen the crushing pressure of being interesting by focusing on being interested.
Understand how to stay tuned in to the conversation by picking up on often-ignored (but crucially important) nonverbal cues.
Banish meaningless small talk and learn how to ask questions that build rapport and natural conversation.

> *'You can never be sure who you are dealing with. A man who is of little importance and means today can be a person of power tomorrow.'*

> *'Judge a man by his questions, not by his answers.'*

It’s a common belief that your first reaction is the most honest, but I disagree. Your first reaction is usually outdated. Either it’s an answer you came up with long ago and now use instead of thinking, or it’s triggering a knee-jerk emotional response to something that happened long ago. -- Derek Sivers

> *'Never argue with a fool, onlookers may not be able to tell the difference.' -- Mark Twain*

Don’t Talk to Somone. Talk with Them

I walk up to perfect strangers and start a conversation?

It comes back to the same advice we’ve given again and again: You have to be interested to be interesting.
Take an interest in the other person, and they’ll walk away thinking you are interesting.
Ask a question. Listen to the answer. Respond in the form of a statement.

But What about Keeping a Conversation Going?
Lots of people claim they’ve got nothing exciting to say during a conversation -- and it gets awkward when the initial small talk winds down. You actually do have interesting things to say, it just takes a little bit of preparation and getting to know yourself.

Keep a journal and write about what you’re looking forward to and excited about in life. That’ll keep ideas on the tip of your tongue, ready to discuss. It’s okay to write the same thing over and over each day. The point is to move what’s exciting you to the top of your mental list so you’re ready to go if an opportunity presents.

Calm is largely a matter of slowing your speech down. Warmth comes from smiling while you speak.

### On business and entrepreneurship

Business exchanges value for money.  
Focus on areas where you are motivated to add value AND there's demand.

> *'What you need to start a new business: generosity.' -- Derek Sivers*

> *'Focus on what can you give instead of focusing in making money. Find your market and you'll get the reward.'*

> *'Money is energy.'*

> *'Money is the expression of your creativity.'*

> *'To make money focus on the fun.'*

> *'Scratch your own itch it's good only as a start.'*

> *'In some complex and mature markets if you start too small you will never be able to compete with existent players. «Starting up in a garage» works mostly on new and undeveloped markets.'*

> *'Sara Blakely used the word «empower» several times. Spanx clothes gives women more confidence. Empowers women. The Belly Art Project empowers pregnant women'*

Validate your business by finding paying clients.

> *'Without customers, you don’t have a business. You have a hobby.' -- Don Peppers & Martha Rogers*

> *'The consumer votes with his wallet.'*

> *'Test sales first. If something is worth doing, sales will come easy and dollars will be high. If you have to drag people along kicking and screaming, you’re wasting your time. If they were in, they'd be in on day one.'*

> *'Do things manually at first. You don’t have to build an elaborate system to get started. Get one client and do everything the hard way. Only after business is over running your ability to do things manually you do have to worry about automation. Don’t put a bunch of effort in on the front end to find out there’s no demand.'*

> *'In general, it's not about what you know, it's about who trusts you to solve their problems.  
Often, that requires the technical skills to reliably solve their problems.  
Always, that requires the communication skills to persuade someone you can solve their problems.'*

Successful *entrepreneurs* are good risk managers.

> *'Be cautious. Entrepreneurs normally take a big risk and offset it with cautious moves (e.g. day job). Entrepreneurs are more risk averse than general population.'*

> *'Entrepreneurs prepare for bad. They budget pessimistically using the worst case scenario.'*

> *'When evaluating an idea make sure the math scales. E.g. If you’re looking for a restaurant location, look at how many seats, average price of meal, average turnover time, multiply it out. Will even max capacity pay the rent? How many potential sales, how much does it cost to reach them, what is a conversion rate to expect? How much can you produce in an hour, will that ever pay you enough?'*

> *'Startup fortune cookie: that company that seems so interested in buying you won't.'*

<!--
There is a golden rule, long cherished by restaurateurs, for determining whether a business is viable. Rent should take up no more than 25 percent of your revenue, another 25 percent should go toward payroll, and 35 percent should go toward the product. The remaining 15 percent is what you take home. There's an even more elegant version of that rule: Make your rent in four days to be profitable, a week to break even. If you haven't hit the latter mark in a month, close.

You Have to Beat Your “Hopium” Addiction
If you want to wean yourself off this potent “substance” the first step is to cultivate a sense of positive skepticism.
“How could this decision negatively affect my financial future and stability.”

It's not even about marketing, just building something of actual value. I doubt this girl has spent much if anything on marketing.

4. Focus on Revenue Generating Activities

One of the simplest habits that you can start implementing today is to shift all of your focus towards revenue generating activities.
Plain and simple, if it is not going to earn you money, then don’t do it. Focus only on the activities that are going to push the envelope forward for you and your company and result in an influx of cash.
If there are tasks that need to be done that do not directly result in the generation of revenue, then outsource them so that you have more time to work on building your cash flow

there's not a lot competition neither a lot of people looking for change. our biggest competitor is indifference and inaction. people are already solving their problems, better or worse. very few people are always researching for something better.

as long as we’re not on the good side, we say ‘what the hell?’ because we don’t enjoy the middle ground. The middle ground is not helping us define who we are. Rather than trying to fix a problem that we see as mostly broken, it’s common for us to hope for a clean slate or a reset button of some kind. This is why mechanisms like Catholic confession are so powerful.

You only have to be really right once.
- Mark Zuckerberg thought that facebook was going to be a college directory and that was it.
- Bill Gates didn’t think the Internet had any potential. Seriously.
- History is filled with examples of people like this. They were right about one thing one time and made so much money that it allows them to be consistently wrong over and over again in big ways because their underlying model was right the first time. They had the resources to correct any mistakes and to try a lot of other things, most of which will fail.
If you only have to be right once, your goal must be to allow yourself many opportunities to be wrong and still keep going.

### On selling, negotiation and price

We're all in sales. You're in sales anytime you interact with anybody.

Sales used to be about information asymmetry but times are changing.  
Now it's mostly [applied persuasion](#on-charming) and keeping relationships.

> *'To sell is to deal with objections.'*

> *'Best sellers are ambiverts.'*

<!--
Advertising is a symptom not of excess consumption but of excess production. And all communication is a form of mind control.

irritation -> challenge people to make something that they don't want to do
agitation -> challenge people to make something that they want to do. suggesting ego etc

agitate more than irritate

mimicking people gestures and words works!

So can you pitch me what our company does?

people minds work by association.
pre-suasion

use testimonials that allow people to see themselves in that testimony
people are intrigued by mystery! stories!

get to objections

when you have passion you communicate better

intro: //clay hebert
I help (or a derivative) investors (target: people is too generalist but don't over tailor it) to build better things (skill. use intrigue and confidence)
6 or 7 words - short and sweet and confident and interesting.

ask them first so you can costumise it for the context and make it more relevant.

then give an interesting story: choose one testimonial
instead of detail and inaccurate.

success in sales
ocean of rejection. face your failures is a good indicator of being a good seller.
most rejections are not your fault.

I use to go into job interviews with a story in mind. All an interviewer really wants to know is if he can spend eight hours a day around you

traditional selling: -> extroverts -> cold calling -> tech made it more difficult
Intruding (to get your foot in the door)
Pitching (to persuade the customer to buy)
Persisting (to push until you make the sale)

effective selling: -> ambiverts and introverts -> We don't need hunters, just farmers
Research (to understand the customer - time spent alone on the Web, reading and analyzing information)
Listening (to understand individual needs - being patient and quiet while remaining open to new ideas and perspectives)
Reacting (to adapt to the identified needs - letting the other person set the pace and the agenda)

If They Can’t Pay, Walk Away
-->

Negotiation establishes the price (exchange rate between money and value).
That said, a bad/good negotiation means that you are adding more/less value than receiving for it.

> *'You don’t get what you deserve in life, you only get what you negotiate.'*

> *'Pay too much for everything. The effort spent getting a deal is only a distraction and attention is your most limited resource.' -- Allen Tucker*

To negotiate is to have options.  
Negotiate while advancing. The more you take, the more you can give back in meaningless concessions.

> *'Control the options: get others to play with the cards you deal.' -- Robert Greene (31st law of power)*

> *'When people feel they have a choice, they walk into your trap that much more easily.'*

> *'When asking for help, appeal to people’s self-interest, never to their mercy or gratitude.' -- Robert Greene (13th law of power)*

«What’s your best out-the-door price?»
«Can you do X% below that?»
«If you can reach my price, I’ll buy today.»

Never negotiate with binary questions: 

> *'«What can you do?» instead of «Will you do this?»'*

How to say no?

> *'«How am I supposed to do that?». «How» gives people an opportunity to show how smart they are.'*

Tone of voice is a big clue to know with whom we are negotiating:

> *'The analytical cold guy is very patient;  
The assertive guy (eg. Trump) wants to make it fast;  
For the accomodator, the relationship is the most important'*

> *'People may or may not say what they mean,” he explained, “but they always say something designed to get what they want.' -- David Mamet*

> *'On negotiation you don't need to match the other person mood, you should be playful and smart, taking the other to mirror your good mood also.'*

> *'Mirroring and reword. repeating the last one to three words of the other person. it opens up people's brain. Its' very effective.'*test the firmness of what they want. the others had to think about it. people didn't even realize it.'*

HOWEVER... always strive to achieve a win-win situation. The deal will fall if both sides don't take what they need from it.

> *'Peace cannot be kept by force. It can only be achieved by understanding.' -- Albert Einstein*

> *'You can’t make a good deal with a bad person.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'The most dangerous negotiation is the one you don’t know you’re in.'*

<!--
“You don’t convince people by challenging their longest and most firmly held opinions. You find common ground and work from there. Or you look for leverage to make them listen. Or you create an alternative with so much support from other people that the opposition voluntarily abandons its views and joins your camp.”
— Ryan Holiday, The Obstacle Is the Way

REMeMBER PEOPLE THAT THEY HAVE CHOICES, That they can control.

never split the difference

Negotiate contracts in minute detail on the front end so that you aren’t negotiating after work is done, investments are made, and you have no bargaining power. This is especially important if the relationship between people is important as it avoids conflict later on.

make an agreement on a standard of value.
my standard of value for a weekend: some combination of rejuvenation and human connection.
normally we fall into habits. we don't do what is best for ourselves.
people have different standards of value: weekend example
rejuvenation and human conception will derail to your habits.

Alex says you can even create a worksheet for yourself by asking clear and direct questions like:

What am I negotiating?
What is my timeline? (This will affect your urgency.)
Who are the parties involved? (Asking questions will ensure you are dealing with the decision-maker.)
What are my interests in this particular case?

when asked for a number:
“I’m looking at a few different offers and opportunities — what were you thinking?”

When you do get an offer, Alex recommends not counteroffering immediately. “Say thank you for the offer and that you are grateful for the opportunity, and then ask if there is any flexibility on the base.

A great closing line: “Based on other opportunities, if you can match this (salary) I can give notice tomorrow.”

Alex points out that he wouldn’t hire someone who would simply accept the first offer he gives.

### On relationships

Relationships are based on mutual [trust](#on-trust).

> *'A great relationship is about finding the similarities and respect the differences.'*

> *'Focus on what you can give not what you can get. You only receive in proportion to what you give.'*

> *'Trust someone if they say they are human and susceptible to conflicts of interest but actively avoiding such conflicts.'*

HOWEVER... after taking the first step [mirror](#on-mirroring) their behavior. Run away from mediocrity and be ready to loose people.

> *'Don't hide your feelings from people who show you theirs.'*

> *'Forget those who forget you. Those who want to stay in your life, will always find a way.'*

> *'If you are lonely when you are not alone, you are in bad company.'*

> *'Humans make connections. Sometimes these connections grow. Sometimes they stay the same. Sometimes they collapse.'*

> *'The free soul is rare, but you know it when you see it - basically because you feel good, very good, when you are near or with them.' -- Charles Bukowski*

> *'If a person is nice to you and to nobody else, that person is not nice.'*

> *'You loose your identity, you loose people.' -- Amy Cuddy*

> *'Don't let people that are bad influences to put you down.'*

<!--
trust and vulnerability are conected.

first we judge trust, before strength.
we build trust through presence. leadership is based on trust.

### On lovers

Never love anyone who treats you like you're ordinary.

> *'Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength, while loving someone deeply gives you courage.' -- Lao Tzu*

> *'Every person feels loved in a different form.'*

> *'Love doesn’t hurt. Expectations do.'*

HOWEVER...

> *'Love me when I least deserve it, because that's when I really need it.' -- Swedish proverb*

HINTS:

> *'If you are struggling in your relationships, odds are, you are withholding your truth from your woman.
You need to open up, tell her the truth, be honest with her without fear of outcome and without any neediness from her.'*

> *'On a serious conversation with a SO, instead of generalizing, talk about three things:  
First, your observations, or what you have noticed is happening in your relationship.  
Next talk about how the observation has made you feel. Finally, discuss your values.'*

Keep separate bank accounts.

> *'Spouses should have the freedom and autonomy to buy what they want, but only after bills are automatically paid. People value things differently. Having to justify every expense makes you feel like you’re being watched. This breeds resentment. Most marriages end in divorce, most of them over money.'* 

How to move on?

> *'Men experience many passions in a lifetime. One passion drives away the one before it.' -- Paul Newman*

### On family and friends

You need to build your board of directors. Life is meant to be lived in community.

> *'Seek out mentors and friends who are achieving on a higher level than you who are willing to call you out on your failures and lift you up for your successes. Once you build this infrastructure of support and accountability, your life will radically transform.'*

> *'Cleave from your family but then come back. You need to be independent and loyal at the same time.'*

> *'Your friends are the ones that go to your funeral AND in a day of rain.'*

> *'You're never too old to make a friend. Always be looking for a new one.  
If a buddy calls and needs to get a drink, go. No matter the hour, how busy you are, or what else you have going on.'*

HOWEVER... choose who surrond you: you are the average of these people  
You will waste your life trying to make those around into who you want them to be.

> *'If you're the smartest in the room, you're in the wrong room.'*

> *'Infection: avoid the unhappy and unlucky.' -- Robert Greene (10th law of power)*

> *'When you enter a workplace, think that you will become like them and not the opposite.'*

HINT: resist to temptation of working with family and friends.

> *'There will be always problems of fixing hierarchy when working with friends. Peers are peers, not boss and employee.'*

> *'Keep your friends for friendship, work with the skilled and competent.'*

> *'Never put too much trust in friends, learn how to use enemies.' -- Robert Greene (2nd law of power)*

<!--
4. Surround Yourself with People Who are Smarter than You 
One of the first steps to becoming a more successful in all areas of your life is to surround yourself with people who are better than you in every area of life.
If you want to improve your bank account, get around millionaires.
If you want to improve your body, befriend competitive athletes
If you want to improve your love life, go hang out with the town “Casanova”.
When you are intentional about surrounding yourself with the right people, you will find every area of your life accelerating.
Jim Rohn said it best, “You are the average of the five people you spend your time with most.”

If you spend the majority of your time in worlds where people are accomplishing incredible things, all of a sudden that starts to seem normal.

> *'Family is not an important thing, it’s everything.' -- Michael J Fox*

### On rewards

Always be generous: a low value gift can have the opposite effect.

> *'Negative reinforcement isn’t as effective as positive reinforcement - even for people. Punishment only works near the situation that did that to you.'*

> *'Always give best in class: practical luxuries make better gifts than merchandise branded with your company’s logo.'*

<!--
Here’s the reality: The people who love you most can care less about how much money you make or what gifts you can send them. What they really want is your time, presence and attention.

### On conflicts

Don't avoid *relevant* conflicts. Small conflicts will grow into big conflicts.  
Neutrality is not possible. Anyway preserve your [freedom](#on-freedom).

> *'Avoiding conflict will not keep peace, will rot it.  
Rotten peace builds resentment.'*

<!--
conflict resolution:
- Offer Value from the Start: Set the stage by coming in smiling. Pay a compliment, make a joke, shake hands, or give a high five to get the interaction off to a friendly start.
- Take Responsibility
- Show Some Empathy
- Use “We” to Show You’re on the Same Team
- Bring Options to the Table: A high-value person always knows what they want before they come to the table. They also understand that it’s much easier to negotiate down

### On criticism and envy

Outliers inspire envy. [Intelligence](/chapter_appendix.md#on-intelligence), [wealth](/chapter_appendix.md#on-wealth), [ambition](/chapter_appendix.md#on-ambition-and-motivation), [fame](/chapter_appendix.md#on-fame), [luck](/chapter_appendix.md#on-luck), [beauty](/chapter_appendix.md#on-beauty), [health](/chapter_appendix.md#on-stress-and-health), freedom and a mix of them ([lifestyle](/chapter_appendix.md#on-lifestyle)) are the main triggers. 

> *'Great spirits have always found violent opposition from mediocrities. The latter cannot understand it when a man does not thoughtlessly submit to hereditary prejudices but honestly and courageously uses his intelligence.' -- Albert Einstein*

> *'They called her witch because she knew how to heal herself.'*

> *'Think as you like but behave like others.'  
'Never appear too perfect.' -- Robert Greene (38th and 46th law of power)*

> *'If A is a success in life, then A = X + Y + Z. Work is X; Y is play; and Z is keeping your mouth shut.' -- Albert Einstein*

> *'Have exactly one vice. Two is too much. None makes you boring. Drink cocktails. Beer is for uncreative people.'*

When people criticize your life they are speaking about their fears and limitations not yours.  
Only take advice from [those achieving what you want to achieve](#on-feedback). Ignore and be flattered by the rest.

> *'The dogs bark but the caravan moves on.' -- Arab proverb*

> *'Consensus happens just in the beginning and in the end of something.'*

> *'Once they stop talking to you, they start to talk about you.'*

HOWEVER... beware of blindspots, not all criticism is envy.

> *'When somebody says something bad about you, is negativity. When everyone says it, is advice.'*

> *'If too many users are wrong, it's probably your fault.'*

### On following the herd

Most people are other people. Their thoughts are someone else opinions and they jump to conclusions.

> *'There are no smart people or stupid people, just people being smart or being stupid. Being smart means thinking things through - trying to find the real answer, not the first answer. Being stupid means avoiding thinking by jumping to conclusions. Jumping to a conclusion is like quitting a game: you lose by default.That’s why saying «I don’t know» is usually smart, because it’s refusing to jump to a conclusion. So when someone says «They are so stupid!» - it means they’ve stopped thinking.'*

> *'Everyone is born a genius, but the process of living de-geniuses them.' -- Buckminster Fuller*
	
From Scott Adams (Dilbert):
> Rational People: Use data and reason to arrive at truth. (This group is mostly imaginary.)
> Word-Thinkers: Use labels, word definitions, and analogies to create the illusion of rational thinking. This group is 99% of the world.
> Persuaders: Use simplicity, repetition, emotion, habit, aspirations, visual communication, and other tools of persuasion to program other people and themselves. This group is about 1% of the population and effectively control the word-thinkers of the world.

3 types of man: spectators, the dabblers and the men in the arena.

As humans, we are tribal by nature. Our natural default is to see ourselves as part of some group that’s struggling against some other group(s) at all times. And once we’re part of our little group, our little tribe, we adopt all sorts of biases and preferences. We construct belief systems that justify our group’s power and superiority. We create tests of whether other people are “true” and “pure” members of our group, and we either shame any “non-believers” into conformity or simply expel them from the tribe.

Once a philosophy goes tribal, its beliefs no longer exist to serve some moral principle, but rather they exist to serve the promotion of the group.

But the problem is that, like I said, feminism, in the process of enacting all of the progress of the last 50 years, became more than a philosophy—it became an institution. And institutions are always primarily interested in sustaining themselves first and engaging with the world as it is second.

The way you destroy stereotypes is by being the contradiction of the stereotype. These are the real activists. This is where real progress happens. Yes, women still face stereotypes and poor treatments in these industries. But this is the trench today’s feminists should be fighting in. This is where they should be making their push -- and not by talking about it online, but by actually being there.

Tribal feminists, in the name of fighting shame and oppression, shame and oppress views that contradict their own.

And once your philosophy has inverted upon itself, it becomes corrupt. Just like the old communist societies of the 20th century, once you set out to provide perfect equality for everybody, you achieve the exact opposite. What was once progressive becomes regressive. You become so busy policing people’s thoughts and opinions that you lose track of what actually matters.

### On politics

'Politicians don't get educated. They get bought.'

> *'The hardest thing in the world to understand is the income tax.'*

> *'80% of all people are voluntarily overpaying on their taxes.'*

> *'The moment you cross a second border, you are an economic migrant, not a refugee.'*

> *'Good fences make good neighbors.'*

> *'Morality is the way that we would like the world to be, economics is the way that the world actually works.' -- Steven Levitt*

> *'Politician is a profession that doesn't like risk. Decisions are made on the lowest risk of offending anybody.'*

> *'I love individuals. I hate groups of people. I hate a group of people with a ‘common purpose’. Because pretty soon they have little hats. And armbands. And fight songs. And a list of people they’re going to visit at 3am. So, I dislike and despise groups of people. But I love individuals.' -- George Carlin*

> *'Even the most practical man of affairs is usually in the thrall of the ideas of some long-dead economist.' -- John Maynard Keynes*

> *'To reduce corruption diminish people involved on analogic processes.'*

# 2.3 - On teams

### On leadership

Being a leader is different from being a boss. Leadership is based on mutual [trust](#on-trust).

> *'A leader is best when people barely know he exists, when his work is done, his aim fulfilled, they will say: we did it ourselves.' -- Lao Tzu*

> *'If you want to lead, simply act with confidence and others around you will pick up on that energy and fall in line. No explicit statements needed. If someone fails to fall in line, either your leadership needs improvement or you need to excise them from your group.'*

> *'Be royal in your own fashion: act like a king to be treated like one.' -- Robert Greene (34th law of power)*

> *'The only thing that gives orders, is balls.' -- Tony Montana*

Being a leader requires to be equal parts manager and psychotherapist.

> *'There are no bad teams, only bad leaders.'*

> *'The secret to motivating people and maintaining their morale is to get them to think less about themselves and more about the group.'*

> *'People don't follow robots.'*

People want leadership because they want autonomy and influence.

> *'The person who clears the path ultimately controls its direction, just as the canvas shapes the painting.' -- Ryan Holiday*

> *'Influence is more powerful than money. The reason millionaires are depressed is that they don’t know the difference.'*

HOWEVER... Be humble.

> *'Keep your attempts at intimidation under control. Be careful not to become intoxicated by the power fear brings.'*

> *'I’m not here to help; I’m here to learn.'*

> *'No one is smarter than a small group.'*

<!--
In order to be successful you will probably have to build a team of successful people to support you. You need them to be paid well and well taken care of. You must make it easy for them to succeed and you must teach them how to do it. You won’t do it alone. Put employees before customers. Owners make more than employees in the long run.

We advance the welfare of others — often unconsciously — by sharing resources, cooperating, and collaborating within a social structure. As perhaps an unintended consequence, we find ourselves gaining power. Most often, this power is something that’s given to us, and not something we set out to seize. This runs directly counter to the popular belief that power is attained by becoming a Machiavellian super villain and using force, manipulation, deception, and strategic ruthlessness to take it at the expense of others.
Individuals demonstrating value to other individuals — or companies demonstrating value to a society — gain power as a direct result.

leaders
backup what you're preaching
make yourself as part of a team
make people feel as part of a family

leader persuader - mix com persuasion 

Fire customers that cause you to much stress or that cost too much to service.

Always be clear and specific about what you expect from other people. You can not expect from them what you haven’t articulated…usually many times and in writing. Also plan for them to fail you.

a good leader: a) knows when to speak and when don't. b) knows to create a vision of where they wanna go.

When someone is out of line, don’t let it slide too far.
If you let someone treat your poorly for too long in order to avoid conflict, things will get so bad that you then have to have a huge fight in order to correct them. What could have been very small is now a real problem that may compromise your relationship, business, etc.

### On management and delegation

Managing is delegating. Your speed as a manager is the speed of the team.

> *'Don’t postpone to tomorrow what other people can do for you today.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'Be productive, not cheap. Stop dicking around trying to figure stuff out that someone else already knows.'*

> *'If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.' -- African proverb*

> *'A manager should make himself 2 questions a day:   
«What is important to accomplish?» (where are you going)  
«Where was I uncomfortable the day before?» (what went right and where do you need support)  
The speed that you offload your stuff will be the speed of your team.'*

> *'Your productivity as a manager is measured as the productivity of your team. Being seated making stuff is not productive.
The key principle is putting your team’s productivity first. Remember, you are a communication hub and a multiplier. Think about the things you can delegate vs. the things that only you can do. If you truly work for your people instead of hiding at your desk, just tell yourself: what I accomplished today is not yet visible, but it will be.'*

> *'Productivity is different from workflow engineering.'*

> *'Instead of generalizing and saying «management is useless», it's more correct to say «bad management is counterproductive».'*

For that you need to [communicate](#on-communication).

> *'Spend one hour a day just talking to your people and everything will be OK.'*

> *'The goal is to move everyone up from «unconfident and incompetent» to «confident and competent».' -- exelius*

> *'Start a meeting with an overachieving question: «how can we raise sales by 12%?»'*

How to give feedback?

1. Ask instead of telling.

> *'«Is that the best you can do?»  
«Interesting, how do you feel about it?»  
«What does your team think?»  
«Why did you decide to do X in that order?» This creates a dialog, instead of a debate where each side first stakes out positions. Lead your people to discover what you would have suggested. Smart people will get to the same place you were going, or if you are humble enough to listen, you may learn something.'*

2. If you're certain the delivered work is not good enough give a reason.

> *'«Can you take another look at this for XYZ reasons?». This gives the employee ownership of the final deliverable, while still prompting them to deal with problems they overlooked. «Because» is a great motivator.'*

HOWEVER... gaining an understanding and giving appropriate feedback makes your juniors feel like what they are doing is important. Pounding directives down or not giving any direction are demotivators.

> *'Delegating isn’t as easy as it looks. It takes some real chutzpah to make someone do your work for insufficient compensation while you rake in the big bucks.'*

<!--
> *'Too busy pretending I'm occupied.'*

boss ask employee to do x. employee resist, boss come back later after thinking about his resistance, maybe you can do something about

### On hiring and being hired

Trial most but only hire likable persons that «get shit done».  
Your goal in business should be to «fire» yourself and hire people who are better at your job than you are.  
To build an empire you must become a master at finding and hiring talent.

> *'Two valid methods: hiring on culture contribution and hiring on culture matching.'*

> *'Bad professionals make money off their customers, good professionals make money for their customers.' -- Jacques Mattheij*

> *'Refuse to work with people you don’t like. One person in the office is all it takes to make everyone miserable. Don’t tolerate these people.'*

> *'He who works with his hands is a laborer.  
He who works with his hands and his head is a craftsman.  
He who works with his hands and his head and his heart is an artist.' -- St. Francis of Assisi*

> *'We value “T-shaped” people. That is, people who are both generalists (highly skilled at a broad set of valuable things—the top of the T) and also experts (among the best in their field within a narrow discipline—the vertical leg of the T) (...) An expert who is too narrow has difficulty collaborating. A generalist who doesn’t go deep enough in a single area ends up on the margins, not really contributing as an individual. Where you choose to be deep should be an area of interest to you and which the market values.' -- Valve employee book*

How to attract and keep talented people? Respect them.  
You'll never respect them if you don't reward them accordingly.

> *'Create contracts that build up «golden handcuffs» offering your new hires the ability to earn as much as they want, provided that they are earning you even more income in the process.'*

HOWEVER good employeees are not easy to find.

> *'Always look for internal spies, people in the enemy camp who are dissatisfied and have an ax to grind.'*

> *'They don’t want to lose you. They don’t want to lose the negotiation. And they don’t want to restart the hiring process. Hiring is a long and expensive process.'*

<!--
> *'A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.' -- Robert Heinlein*

When applying for a job be more of a consultant than an applicant.

### On career

Avoid the trap of following one set career path. It will be easier to pivot when needed.  
Being an employee is risky.

> *'The moment you [rigidly follow a plan](#on-adapting) set in your youth, you lock yourself into a position, and the times will ruthlessly pass you by.'*

> *'If your job doesn't require originality, next decade you might not have one.'*

> *'The interesting jobs are the ones that you make up.' -- Chris Young*

> *'Is it better to be good at many things or great at one thing?  
To be an entrepreneur you need to know a little about a lot of things.  
To be employed, you'll do better as a specialist. If you pick the right specialization.'*

> *'I work for money, if you want loyalty hire a dog.'*

> *'The boss wants the most sophisticated talent he can get, and he doesn't want to pay anything for it. Every penny he pays, and every second of your life he doesn't get for it, is a failure in his eyes.'*

> *'My luggage is always ready.' -- Portuguese soccer coach*

How to keep a job?

> *'While deep work will promote you, shallow work will only prevent you from being fired.'  
'Career capital is the unique skills that make you rare and valuable'  
'Be so good that they cannot ignore you' -- Cal Newport*

differentiate yourself / volunteer for assignments
becoming the go to guy for some questions

How to «pivot» career?

> *1) use the career fuel (transportable skills) that you have: soft skills (e.g. persuasive communication: pitching and change somebody's opinion, emotional intelligence, ability to read the room, ability to build trust, ability to retain talent) and hard skills.
write a pitch, are u persuasive, can you change somebody else opinion. making a 2 minute youtube, etc.<br>
2) find the people that were working for them. top leaders ask for help and give knowledge away. more open source.<br>
3) take risks to boost your immune system.*

> *'People pivot to near areas, combining two skills.'*

> *'Your work is the greatest mean at your disposal for expressing your social intelligence.'*

How to get employers feedback?  
If you ask them why did they asked you for an interview, they will describe your strengths.

<!--
100% time -> 100% results  
20% time -> 80%results  
So: 100% on one thing = 80% on 5 things!  

> *'How to return to an workplace:  
- reframe your experience. Use today and future jargons. Make your homework.  
- refresh your skill set, if you got rusty.  
- career ecosystems, get back into them, reconnect.  
- reboot self confidence. Surround yourself with confident people.'

Happy, Smart, and Useful

### On hierarchy

Everything is hierarchy.  
Only comedians can speak the truth without consequences.

> *'Never outshine the master.'  
'Know who you’re dealing with: do not offend the wrong person.'  
'Avoid stepping into a great man’s shoes.' -- Robert Greene (1st, 9th and 41st law of power)*

> *'Weak managers believe if an employee becomes irreplaceable, they have become expendable. Keeping employees dispensable is more important than keeping skilled talent. Their actions aren't random or stupid.'*

> *'Higher the status, more exposure to parasites whose transmission isn't environmentally mediated.'*

> *'The highest form of the art of power is the ability to distinguish the wolves from the lambs, the foxes from hares, the hawks from vultures.'*

> *'Social cartography: who's the decision maker, to whom people are speaking and who is speaking.'*

HOWEVER... don't vow to the gatekeepers.

> *'Most people are basically afraid of their superiors. Someone’s position does not make them important. You can replace them as quickly as they can replace you. It's a business relationship.'*

> *'Only the truth is funny.' -- Rick Reynolds*
