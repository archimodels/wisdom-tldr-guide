# 2.1 - On interaction

### On networking

Don't isolate yourself. The people you know and whether they like you will determine what opportunities you get.

> *'The purpose of high education is first and foremost to meet people and build relationships.'*

> *'To develop your intellectual powers at the expense of the social is to retard your own progress to mastery.'*

> *'Do not build fortresses to protect yourself: isolation is dangerous.'<br>
'Play the perfect courtier.' -- Robert Greene (4th and 24th law of power)*

> *'You're never too old to make a friend. Always be looking for a new one.'*

> *'If a buddy calls and needs to get a drink, go. No matter the hour, how busy you are, or what else you have going on.'*

HINTS:

> *'Networking types: advocates a, boomerang b, celebrities c, drainers d<br>
shark, dolphin, drowner'*

> *'Social inadequacy AKA creepiness is based on unpredictability.'*

> *'Regarding networking adding value is everything.'*

> *'Prepare an elevator pitch.'*


<!--
we don’t like people that see us in a way that doesn’t resonate with how we see ourselves — even if they see us…better than we see ourselves.

building a network is critical

3) Find out what people actually want

if people forget it wasn't a good network anyway

A person starts to live when he can live outside himself. Be in the moment instead of being in your head.

network --
raw connections
community of experts (that give you good answers)
critical colleagues (10 people that make a big difference in your immediate career) - boss / boss's boss

ask advice to a person that you know, everybody says that you're the best to explain that. people will like you more

build rapport - cut the BS. speak whats in your mind, sometimes it backfires. be real

i didn't get your text can you resend it? less strong. will you write a whole book in your phone? make it non threating

> *'on networking: expand from too dense networks. custom tailor teams from project to project. same team from same project is not the best option. if anybody in your list knows everybody is a big pro

introvert is not shyness
most things are not binary.
introvert and extrovert scale 1-7
introvert and extrovert scale 1-7
it's hard to pass from a 2 to 7 but you can pass to a 2 to 3 or 4

And while drumming up new connections by networking is important, it’s even more important to remember and recognize your connections that already exist. buzz marketing
unlocking dormant ties

networking you must exchange value

Personal branding means you are a liar

list the people i met

the importance of enthusiasm; the importance of connecting people; expect magic in any encounter

### On communication

Speak less and listen more: be [humble](#on-humbleness). Listening is powerful.

> *'Listen to many, speak to a few.' -- William Shakespeare*

> *'People don’t listen, they just wait for their turn to talk.' -- Chuck Palahniuk*

> *'Listen to predict a collapse.'*

> *'Arguing as you're right. Listening as you're wrong.'*

> *'You can never be sure who you are dealing with. A man who is of little importance and means today can be a person of power tomorrow.'*

> *'Judge a man by his questions, not by his answers.'*

How talk to people?<br>
Smile, don't ramble, look for external catalysts as hints for stories and questions, talk about your passions instead of accomplishments, don't be stubborn and listen.

> *'Get better asking questions. They are more important than answers.'*

> *'Talk about your passions instead of your accomplishments (aka bragging), transform it in a story.'*

> *'Storytelling is about the details.'*

> *'On improvisation is more productive to say «yes and» instead of «yes but». Get rid of ego and add value. Don't judge.'*

> *'Know how to lead a conversation and how to go with the conversational flow. Get out of your head and become more situationally aware, always looking for external catalysts.'*

> *'You don't always have to get the last word. Make your point and leave it that way. Let go.'*

<!--
It’s a common belief that your first reaction is the most honest, but I disagree. Your first reaction is usually outdated. Either it’s an answer you came up with long ago and now use instead of thinking, or it’s triggering a knee-jerk emotional response to something that happened long ago. -- Derek Sivers

> *'Never argue with a fool, onlookers may not be able to tell the difference.' -- Mark Twain*

Don’t Talk to Somone. Talk with Them

### On business and entrepreneurship

Business exchanges value for money.<br>
Focus on areas where you are motivated to add value AND there's demand.

> *'What you need to start a new business: generosity.' -- Derek Sivers*

> *'Focus on what can you give instead of focusing in making money. Find your market and you'll get the reward.'*

> *'Money is energy.'*

> *'Money is the expression of your creativity.'*

> *'To make money focus on the fun.'*

> *'Scratch your own itch it's good only as a start.'*

> *'In some complex and mature markets if you start too small you will never be able to compete with existent players. «Starting up in a garage» works mostly on new and undeveloped markets.'*

> *'Sara Blakely used the word «empower» several times. Spanx clothes gives women more confidence. Empowers women. The Belly Art Project empowers pregnant women'*

Validate your business by finding paying clients.

> *'Without customers, you don’t have a business. You have a hobby.' -- Don Peppers & Martha Rogers*

> *'The consumer votes with his wallet.'*

> *'Test sales first. If something is worth doing, sales will come easy and dollars will be high. If you have to drag people along kicking and screaming, you’re wasting your time. If they were in, they'd be in on day one.'*

> *'Do things manually at first. You don’t have to build an elaborate system to get started. Get one client and do everything the hard way. Only after business is over running your ability to do things manually you do have to worry about automation. Don’t put a bunch of effort in on the front end to find out there’s no demand.'*

> *'In general, it's not about what you know, it's about who trusts you to solve their problems.<br>
Often, that requires the technical skills to reliably solve their problems.<br>
Always, that requires the communication skills to persuade someone you can solve their problems.'*

Successful *entrepreneurs* are good risk managers.

> *'Be cautious. Entrepreneurs normally take a big risk and offset it with cautious moves (e.g. day job). Entrepreneurs are more risk averse than general population.'*

> *'Entrepreneurs prepare for bad. They budget pessimistically using the worst case scenario.'*

> *'When evaluating an idea make sure the math scales. E.g. If you’re looking for a restaurant location, look at how many seats, average price of meal, average turnover time, multiply it out. Will even max capacity pay the rent? How many potential sales, how much does it cost to reach them, what is a conversion rate to expect? How much can you produce in an hour, will that ever pay you enough?'*

> *'Startup fortune cookie: that company that seems so interested in buying you won't.'*

<!--
There is a golden rule, long cherished by restaurateurs, for determining whether a business is viable. Rent should take up no more than 25 percent of your revenue, another 25 percent should go toward payroll, and 35 percent should go toward the product. The remaining 15 percent is what you take home. There's an even more elegant version of that rule: Make your rent in four days to be profitable, a week to break even. If you haven't hit the latter mark in a month, close.

You Have to Beat Your “Hopium” Addiction
If you want to wean yourself off this potent “substance” the first step is to cultivate a sense of positive skepticism.
“How could this decision negatively affect my financial future and stability.”

It's not even about marketing, just building something of actual value. I doubt this girl has spent much if anything on marketing.

hot to make, how to keep, how to grow money

4. Focus on Revenue Generating Activities

One of the simplest habits that you can start implementing today is to shift all of your focus towards revenue generating activities.
Plain and simple, if it is not going to earn you money, then don’t do it. Focus only on the activities that are going to push the envelope forward for you and your company and result in an influx of cash.
If there are tasks that need to be done that do not directly result in the generation of revenue, then outsource them so that you have more time to work on building your cash flow

there's not a lot competition neither a lot of people looking for change. our biggest competitor is indifference and inaction. people are already solving their problems, better or worse. very few people are always researching for something better.

as long as we’re not on the good side, we say ‘what the hell?’ because we don’t enjoy the middle ground. The middle ground is not helping us define who we are. Rather than trying to fix a problem that we see as mostly broken, it’s common for us to hope for a clean slate or a reset button of some kind. This is why mechanisms like Catholic confession are so powerful.

You only have to be really right once.
- Mark Zuckerberg thought that facebook was going to be a college directory and that was it.
- Bill Gates didn’t think the Internet had any potential. Seriously.
- History is filled with examples of people like this. They were right about one thing one time and made so much money that it allows them to be consistently wrong over and over again in big ways because their underlying model was right the first time. They had the resources to correct any mistakes and to try a lot of other things, most of which will fail.
If you only have to be right once, your goal must be to allow yourself many opportunities to be wrong and still keep going.

### On selling

We're all in sales. You're in sales anytime you interact with anybody.

Sales used to be about information asymmetry but times are changing.<br>
Now it's mostly [applied persuasion](#on-charming) and keeping relationships.

> *'Historically, the seller had more information than the buyer.<br>
Its a different game now. Everybody knows immediately the alternatives.'*

> *'Selling by just keeping in touch.'*

> *'To sell is to deal with objections.'*

> *'Best sellers are ambiverts.'*

<!--
Advertising is a symptom not of excess consumption but of excess production. And all communication is a form of mind control.

irritation -> challenge people to make something that they don't want to do
agitation -> challenge people to make something that they want to do. suggesting ego etc

agitate more than irritate

mimicking people gestures and words works!

So can you pitch me what our company does?

people minds work by association.
pre-suasion

use testimonials that allow people to see themselves in that testimony
people are intrigued by mystery! stories!

get to objections

when you have passion you communicate better

intro: //clay hebert
I help (or a derivative) investors (target: people is too generalist but don't over tailor it) to build better things (skill. use intrigue and confidence)
6 or 7 words - short and sweet and confident and interesting.

ask them first so you can costumise it for the context and make it more relevant.

then give an interesting story: choose one testimonial
instead of detail and inaccurate.

success in sales
ocean of rejection. face your failures is a good indicator of being a good seller.
most rejections are not your fault.

I use to go into job interviews with a story in mind. All an interviewer really wants to know is if he can spend eight hours a day around you
-->

### On negotiation and price

To negotiate is to have options.<br>
Negotiate while advancing. The more you take, the more you can give back in meaningless concessions.

> *'Control the options: get others to play with the cards you deal.' -- Robert Greene (31st law of power)*

> *'When people feel they have a choice, they walk into your trap that much more easily.'*

> *'When asking for help, appeal to people’s self-interest, never to their mercy or gratitude.' -- Robert Greene (13th law of power)*

Never negotiate with binary questions: 

> *'«What can you do?» instead of «Will you do this?»'*

Best way to say no:

> *'«How am I supposed to do that?». «How» gives people an opportunity to show how smart they are.'*

Tone of voice is a big clue to know with whom we are negotiating:

> *'The analytical cold guy is very patient; <br>
The assertive guy (eg. Trump) wants to make it fast; <br>
For the accomodator, the relationship is the most important'*

<!--
“No one’s going to help you in a way that’s not beneficial to them.”

> *'Unexpressed feelings never die.'*
> *'Releasing pressure is different from venting.'*
> *'The more influence somebody is the more they use we / plural pronouns.'*
> *'There are so many wingman breaking communication. looking for cliches, profanity, adjectives, emotions, whats important for them, body language.'*
> *'Listening for things that you didn't see. for incongruence.'*
> *'They will hurt, and than say what you have to say. people then are expecting and it doesn't hurt as much.'*
naming the negatives first.'* 

REMeMBER PEOPLE THAT THEY HAVE CHOICES, That they can control.

you don’t get what you deserve in life, you only get what you negotiate.

never split the difference

Negotiate contracts in minute detail on the front end so that you aren’t negotiating after work is done, investments are made, and you have no bargaining power. This is especially important if the relationship between people is important as it avoids conflict later on.

> *'Instead of generalizing, stick with the facts.'*

make an agreement on a standard of value.
my standard of value for a weekend: some combination of rejuvenation and human connection.
normally we fall into habits. we don't do what is best for ourselves.
people have different standards of value: weekend example
rejuvenation and human conception will derail to your habits.

Only Is Better Than Best

---

“What’s your best out-the-door price?”
“Can you do X% below that?“
“If you can reach my price, I’ll buy today.”

Alex says you can even create a worksheet for yourself by asking clear and direct questions like:

What am I negotiating?
What is my timeline? (This will affect your urgency.)
Who are the parties involved? (Asking questions will ensure you are dealing with the decision-maker.)
What are my interests in this particular case?

when asked for a number:
“I’m looking at a few different offers and opportunities — what were you thinking?”

When you do get an offer, Alex recommends not counteroffering immediately. “Say thank you for the offer and that you are grateful for the opportunity, and then ask if there is any flexibility on the base.

A great closing line: “Based on other opportunities, if you can match this (salary) I can give notice tomorrow.”

Alex points out that he wouldn’t hire someone who would simply accept the first offer he gives.
-->

> *'On negotiation you don't need to match the other person mood, you should be playful and smart, taking the other to mirror your good mood also.'*

> *'mirroring and reword. repeating the last one to three words of the other person. it opens up people's brain. Its' very effective.'*test the firmness of what they want. the others had to think about it. people didn't even realize it.'*

Negotiation establishes the price (exchange rate between money and value).
That said, a bad/good negotiation means that you are adding more/less value to the world than receiving money for it

> *'Pay too much for everything. The effort spent getting a deal is only a distraction and attention is your most limited resource.' -- Allen Tucker*

HOWEVER... always strive to achieve a win-win situation. The deal will fall if both sides don't take what they need from it.

> *'Peace cannot be kept by force. It can only be achieved by understanding.'*

> *'You can’t make a good deal with a bad person.'*

### On relationships

Relationships are based on mutual [trust](#on-trust).

> *'A great relationship is about finding the similarities and respect the differences.'*

> *'Focus on what you can give not what you can get. You only receive in proportion to what you give.'*

<!--
first we judge trust, before strength.
we build trust through presence. leadership is based on trust.

> *'If a person is nice to you and to nobody else, that person is not nice.'*

on a deep relationship, politics must match

“I won’t be less just because you cannot be more”
-->

HOWEVER... after taking the first step [mirror](#on-mirroring) their behavior. Run away from mediocrity and be ready to loose people.

> *'Don't hide your feelings from people who show you theirs.'*

> *'Forget those who forget you. Those who want to stay in your life, will always find a way.'*

> *'If you are lonely when you are not alone, you are in bad company.'*

> *'Humans make connections. Sometimes these connections grow. Sometimes they stay the same. Sometimes they collapse.'*

> *'The free soul is rare, but you know it when you see it - basically because you feel good, very good, when you are near or with them.' -- Charles Bukowski*

> *'You loose your identity, you loose people.' -- Amy Cuddy*

> *'Don't let people that are bad influences to put you down.'*

### On lovers

Never love anyone that treats you like you're ordinary.

> *'Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength, while loving someone deeply gives you courage.' -- Lao Tzu*

> *'Every person feels loved in a different form.'*

> *'Love doesn’t hurt. Expectations do.'*

HOWEVER...

> *'Love me when I least deserve it, because that's when I really need it.' -- Swedish proverb*

HINTS:

> *'If you are struggling in your relationships, odds are, you are withholding your truth from your woman.
You need to open up, tell her the truth, be honest with her without fear of outcome and without any neediness from her.'

> *'On a serious conversation with a SO, instead of generalizing, talk about three things:<br>
First, your observations, or what you have noticed is happening in your relationship.<br>
Next talk about how the observation has made you feel. Finally, discuss your values.'*

Keep separate bank accounts.

> *'Spouses should have the freedom and autonomy to buy what they want, but only after bills are automatically paid. People value things differently. Having to justify every expense makes you feel like you’re being watched. This breeds resentment. Most marriages end in divorce, most of them over money.'* 

How to move on?

> *'Men experience many passions in a lifetime. One passion drives away the one before it.' -- Paul Newman*

<!--
1. You Need to Partner with Someone Who Wants you to Be All You Can Be

### On family and friends

You need to build your board of directors. Life is meant to be lived in community.

> *'Seek out mentors and friends who are achieving on a higher level than you who are willing to call you out on your failures and lift you up for your successes. Once you build this infrastructure of support and accountability, your life will radically transform.'*

> *'Cleave from your family but then come back. You need to be independent and loyal at the same time.'*

HOWEVER... choose who surrond you: you are the average of these people<br>
You will waste your life trying to make those around into who you want them to be.

> *'If you're the smartest in the room, you're in the wrong room.'*

> *'Get proximity to successful, happy, and rich people. Be cool. They will likely influence you automatically.'*

> *'Infection: avoid the unhappy and unlucky.' -- Robert Greene (10th law of power)*

> *'here will be always problems of fixing hierarchy when working with friends. Peers are peers, not boss and employee.'*

> *'Keep your friends for friendship, work with the skilled and competent.'*

> *'Never put too much trust in friends, learn how to use enemies.' -- Robert Greene (2nd law of power)*

> *'Your friends are the ones that go to your funeral AND in a day of rain.'*

<!--
you're never a prophet in your homeland.

4. Surround Yourself with People Who are Smarter than You 
One of the first steps to becoming a more successful in all areas of your life is to surround yourself with people who are better than you in every area of life.
If you want to improve your bank account, get around millionaires.
If you want to improve your body, befriend competitive athletes
If you want to improve your love life, go hang out with the town “Casanova”.
When you are intentional about surrounding yourself with the right people, you will find every area of your life accelerating.
Jim Rohn said it best, “You are the average of the five people you spend your time with most.”

### On rewards

Be an expert gift giver.

> *'Negative reinforcement isn’t as effective as positive reinforcement - even for people. Punishment only works near the situation that did that to you.'*

> *'Always be generous: a low value gift can have the opposite effect.'*

> *'Always give best in class: practical luxuries make better gifts than merchandise branded with your company’s logo.'*

### On conflicts

Don't avoid *relevant* conflicts. Small conflicts will grow into big conflicts.<br>
Neutrality is not possible. Anyway preserve your [freedom](#on-freedom).

> *'Avoiding conflict will not keep peace, will rot it.<br>
Rotten peace builds resentment.'*

> *'I am either part of the solution or part of the problem.'*

> *'Well-kept gardens die by pacifism.'*

### On criticism and envy

Outliers inspire envy. [Intelligence](#on-intelligence), [wealth](#on-wealth), [ambition](#on-ambition-and-motivation), [fame](#on-fame), [luck](#on-luck), [beauty](#on-beauty), [health](#on-stress-and-health) and a mix of them ([lifestyle](#on-lifestyle)) are the main triggers. 

> *'Great spirits have always found violent opposition from mediocrities. The latter cannot understand it when a man does not thoughtlessly submit to hereditary prejudices but honestly and courageously uses his intelligence.' -- Albert Einstein*

> *'They called her witch because she knew how to heal herself.'*

> *'Never appear too perfect.' -- Robert Greene (46th law of power)*

> *'Have exactly one vice. Two is too much. None makes you boring. Drink cocktails. Beer is for uncreative people.'*

You’re judged by what you say, not what you think.

> *'Think as you like but behave like others.' -- Robert Greene (38th law of power)*

> *'If A is a success in life, then A = X + Y + Z. Work is X; Y is play; and Z is keeping your mouth shut.' -- Albert Einstein*

When people criticize your life they are speaking about their fears and limitations not yours.<br>
So ignore and be flattered by these people, whether they are bosses, life-long friends, or even family members.

Only take advice from [those who are achieving what you want to achieve](#on-feedback), and ignore the rest.

> *'Never hate people who are jealous of you, but respect their jealousy. They think that you're better than them.'*

> *'Don’t argue your path with other people. Walk it.' -- Lazy Yogi*

> *'The dogs bark but the caravan moves on.' -- Arab proverb*

> *'Consensus happens just in the beginning and in the end of something.'*

HOWEVER... beware of blindspots, not all criticism is envy.

> *'When somebody says something bad about you, is negativity. When everyone says it, is advice.'*

> *'If too many users are wrong, it's probably your fault.'*

> *'The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing.'*

> *'Let me never fall into the vulgar mistake of dreaming that I am persecuted whenever I am contradicted.' -- Ralph Waldo Emerson*

### On following the herd

Most people are other people. Their thoughts are someone else opinions and they jump to conclusions.

> *'Common sense is the collection of prejudices acquired by age eighteen.'*

> *'People accept the defaults very easily.'*

> *'Gold rushes make the shovel sellers rich, not the gold seekers.'*

> *'Nothing is more terrible than to see ignorance in action.' -- Goethe*

> *'The whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, and wiser people so full of doubts. '-- Bertrand Russell*

> *'And those who were seen dancing were thought to be insane by those who could not hear the music.' -- Friedrich Nietzsche*

HOWEVER... smart people don’t think others are stupid and common sense is not so common.

> *'Taking a fence down without knowing why is there.'*

> *'There are no smart people or stupid people, just people being smart or being stupid. Being smart means thinking things through - trying to find the real answer, not the first answer. Being stupid means avoiding thinking by jumping to conclusions. Jumping to a conclusion is like quitting a game: you lose by default.That’s why saying «I don’t know» is usually smart, because it’s refusing to jump to a conclusion. So when someone says «They are so stupid!» - it means they’ve stopped thinking.'*

<!--
Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by neglect. -- Hanlon’s Razor

From Scott Adams (Dilbert):
> Rational People: Use data and reason to arrive at truth. (This group is mostly imaginary.)
> Word-Thinkers: Use labels, word definitions, and analogies to create the illusion of rational thinking. This group is 99% of the world.
> Persuaders: Use simplicity, repetition, emotion, habit, aspirations, visual communication, and other tools of persuasion to program other people and themselves. This group is about 1% of the population and effectively control the word-thinkers of the world.

### On leadership

Being a leader is different from being a boss. Leadership is based on mutual [trust](#on-trust).

> *'A leader is best when people barely know he exists, when his work is done, his aim fulfilled, they will say: we did it ourselves.' -- Lao Tzu*

> *'The secret to motivating people and maintaining their morale is to get them to think less about themselves and more about the group.'*

> *'If you want to lead, simply act with confidence and others around you will pick up on that energy and fall in line. No explicit statements needed. If someone fails to fall in line, either your leadership needs improvement or you need to excise them from your group.'*

> *'Be royal in your own fashion: act like a king to be treated like one.' -- Robert Greene (34th law of power)*

> *'The only thing that gives orders, is balls.' -- Tony Montana*

> *'People don't follow robots.'*

> *'There are no bad teams, only bad leaders.'*

> *'No one is smarter than a small group.'*

People want leadership because they want autonomy and influence.

> *'The person who clears the path ultimately controls its direction, just as the canvas shapes the painting.' -- Ryan Holiday*

> *'Influence is more powerful than money. The reason millionaires are depressed is that they don’t know the difference.'*

HOWEVER...

> *'Keep your attempts at intimidation under control. Be careful not to become intoxicated by the power fear brings.'*

<!--
> *'I’m not here to help; I’m here to learn.'*

reduce you feelings of power to be more effective

boss ask employee to do x
employee resist, boss come back later after thinking about his resistance, maybe you can do something about

Refuse to work with people you don’t like.
Fire customers that cause you to much stress or that cost too much to service.
It takes a very small number of people (one) to ruin an environment. One person in the office is all it takes to make everyone miserable. Don’t tolerate these people. Take it as far as you need to take it. 

In order to be successful you will probably have to build a team of successful people to support you. You need them to be paid well and well taken care of. You must make it easy for them to succeed and you must teach them how to do it. You won’t do it alone. Put employees before customers. Owners make more than employees in the long run.

We advance the welfare of others — often unconsciously — by sharing resources, cooperating, and collaborating within a social structure. As perhaps an unintended consequence, we find ourselves gaining power. Most often, this power is something that’s given to us, and not something we set out to seize. This runs directly counter to the popular belief that power is attained by becoming a Machiavellian super villain and using force, manipulation, deception, and strategic ruthlessness to take it at the expense of others.
Individuals demonstrating value to other individuals — or companies demonstrating value to a society — gain power as a direct result.

leaders
backup what you're preaching
make yourself as part of a team
make people feel as part of a family

When someone is out of line, don’t let it slide too far.
If you let someone treat your poorly for too long in order to avoid conflict, things will get so bad that you then have to have a huge fight in order to correct them. What could have been very small is now a real problem that may compromise your relationship, business, etc.

Always be clear and specific about what you expect from other people. You can not expect from them what you haven’t articulated…usually many times and in writing. Also plan for them to fail you.

a good leader: a) knows when to speak and when don't. b) knows to create a vision of where they wanna go.

### On management

Management is about communication.<br>
Being a leader requires to be equal parts manager and psychotherapist.

> *'Instead of generalizing and saying «management is useless», it's more correct to say «bad management is counterproductive».'*

> *'Spend 1 hour a day just talking to your people and everything will be OK.'*

> *'The goal is to move everyone up from «unconfident and incompetent» to «confident and competent». Some people also go through «incompetent and confident», «where the best option is often to stand back and act as a safety net while letting the person learn whatever lesson they needed to learn.' -- exelius*

HINT: don't add your two cents, specially on subjective stuff, unless you're certain the delivered work is not good enough.<br>
Ask instead of telling. If feedback is needed, give a reason.

> *'Try «can you take another look at this for XYZ reasons?». This gives the employee ownership of the final deliverable, while still prompting them to deal with problems they overlooked.'*

> *'«Because» is a great motivator.'*

> *'«Why did you decide to do X in that order?». This creates a dialog, instead of a debate where each side first stakes out positions. Lead your people to discover what you would have suggested. Smart people will get to the same place you were going, or you may learn something, if you are humble enough to listen.'*

> *'Make questions as: <br>
«Is that the best you can do?» <br>
«Interesting, how do you feel about it?» <br>
«What does your team think?»'*

> *'Start a meeting with an overachieving question: «how can we raise sales by 12%?»'*

HOWEVER... a leader needs [humility](#on-identity). Gaining an understanding and giving appropriate feedback makes your juniors feel like what they are doing is important. Pounding directives down or not giving any direction are demotivators.

### On delegation and productivity

Managing is delegating. Your speed as a manager is the speed of the team.<br>

> *'Don’t postpone to tomorrow what other people can do for you today.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.' -- African proverb*

> *'A manager should make himself 2 questions a day: <br>
«What is important to accomplish?» (where are you going)<br>
«Where was I uncomfortable the day before?» (what went right and where do you need support)<br>
The speed that you offload your stuff will be the speed of your team.'*

> *'Be productive, not cheap. Stop dicking around trying to figure stuff out that someone else already knows.'*

> *'Productivity is different from workflow engineering.'*

> *'Your productivity as a manager is measured as the productivity of your team. Being seated making stuff is not productive.
The key principle is putting your team’s productivity first. Remember, you are a communication hub and a multiplier. Think about the things you can delegate vs. the things that only you can do. If you truly work for your people instead of hiding at your desk, just tell yourself: what I accomplished today is not yet visible, but it will be.'*

### On hiring and keeping talent

Hire most but only retain the best.

> *'Trust someone if they say they are human and susceptible to conflicts of interest but actively avoiding such conflicts.'*

> *'2 valid methods: hiring on culture contribution and hiring on culture matching.'*

> *'Always look for internal spies, people in the enemy camp who are dissatisfied and have an ax to grind.'*

> *'He who works with his hands is a laborer.<br>
He who works with his hands and his head is a craftsman.<br>
He who works with his hands and his head and his heart is an artist.' --  St. Francis of Assisi*

How to keep talented people? Respect them.<br>
You'll never respect them if you don't pay them accordingly.

<!--
make them part of the solution and part of the answer.
you don't pay your family members, if its just money let them go.
everything has to be win win. team members and not employees

Your goal in business should be to “fire” yourself and hire people who are better at your job than you are.
And to build an empire you must become a master at finding and hiring talent.
But you have to learn how to create contracts that build up “golden handcuffs” offering your new hires the ability to earn as much as they want… provided that they are earning you even more income in the process.
From finances to health to relationships, expand your mind and your reality will follow
Ok, so their base pay is only $50,000  a year…
But what is their long term potential when you include bonuses, equity, and commission?
If you offer enough incentives, you will attract incredible talent into your business.

### On being hired

Employers hire you because you are a likable person that «gets shit done».

> *'When applying for a job be more of a consultant than an applicant.'*

> *'Bad professionals make money off their customers, good professionals make money for their customers.' -- Jacques Mattheij*

> *'While deep work will promote you, shallow work will only prevent you from being fired.'<br>
'Career capital is the unique skills that make you rare and valuable'<br>
'Be so good that they cannot ignore you' -- Cal Newport*

> *'Is it better to be good at many things or great at one thing?<br>
To be an entrepreneur you need to know a little about a lot of things.<br>
To be employed, you'll do better as a specialist. If you pick the right specialization.'*

> *'Your work is the greatest mean at your disposal for expressing your social intelligence.'*

HOWEVER... having a job is risky: companies don't care about you.<br>
So avoid the trap of following one set career path. It will be easier to pivot when needed.

> *'I work for money, if you want loyalty hire a dog.'*

> *'The moment you [rigidly follow a plan](#on-adapting) set in your youth, you lock yourself into a position, and the times will ruthlessly pass you by.'*

> *'If your job doesn't require originality, next decade you might not have one.'*

> *'The interesting jobs are the ones that you make up.' -- Chris Young*

> *'We value “T-shaped” people. That is, people who are both generalists (highly skilled at a broad set of valuable things—the top of the T) and also experts (among the best in their field within a narrow discipline—the vertical leg of the T) (...) An expert who is too narrow has difficulty collaborating. A generalist who doesn’t go deep enough in a single area ends up on the margins, not really contributing as an individual. Where you choose to be deep should be an area of interest to you and which the market values.' -- Valve employee book*

> *'The boss wants the most sophisticated talent he can get, and he doesn't want to pay anything for it. Every penny he pays, and every second of your life he doesn't get for it, is a failure in his eyes.'*

> *'My luggage is always ready.' -- Portuguese soccer coach*

> *'People pivot to near areas, combining two skills.'*

> *'Stack of skills -- Scott Adams

100% time -> 100% results<br>
20% time -> 80%results<br>
So: 100% on one thing = 80% on 5 things!<br>

> *'How to pivot:<br>
1) use the career fuel (transportable skills) that you have: soft skills (e.g. persuasive communication: pitching and change somebody's opinion, emotional intelligence, ability to read the room, ability to build trust, ability to retain talent) and hard skills.
write a pitch, are u persuasive, can you change somebody else opinion. making a 2 minute youtube, etc <br>
2) question: talent ledger: what are the people that were working for them. top leaders ask for help and give knowledge away. more open source.<br>
3) take risks to boost your immune system.'*

<!--
differentiate yourself / volunteer for an assignment
becoming the go to guy for some questions

> *'How to return to an workplace:<br>
- reframe your experience. Use today and future jargons. Make your homework.<br>
- refresh your skill set, if you got rusty.<br>
- career ecosystems, get back into them, reconnect.<br>
- reboot self confidence. Surround yourself with confident people.'

Hint from interviews: People will describe your strengths, if you ask them why did you ask him for an interview. Than work from there.

Happy, Smart, and Useful

A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects. -- Robert Heinlein

They don’t want to lose you. They don’t want to lose the negotiation. And they don’t want to restart the hiring process. Hiring is a long and expensive process.

### On hierarchy

Only comedians can speak the truth without consequences. Everything is hierarchy.

> *'Never outshine the master.'<br>
'Know who you’re dealing with: do not offend the wrong person.'<br>
'Avoid stepping into a great man’s shoes.' -- Robert Greene (1st, 9th and 41st law of power)*

> *'Weak managers believe if an employee becomes irreplaceable, they have become expendable. Keeping employees dispensable is more important than keeping skilled talent. Their actions aren't random or stupid.'*

> *'Higher the status, more exposure to parasites whose transmission isn't environmentally mediated.'*

> *'The highest form of the art of power is the ability to distinguish the wolves from the lambs, the foxes from hares, the hawks from vultures.'*

> *'Social cartography: who's the decision maker, to whom people are speaking and who is speaking.'*

HOWEVER... don't vow to the gatekeepers.

> *'Most people are basically afraid of their superiors. Someone’s position does not make them important. You can replace them as quickly as they can replace you. It's a business relationship.'*

> *'Only the truth is funny.' -- Rick Reynolds*
