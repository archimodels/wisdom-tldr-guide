# 2.1 - On interaction

### On networking

Who you know and whether they like you will determine what opportunities you get.  
Make networking an [habit](chapter_1_self.md#on-habits-and-systems).

> *'The enemy of excellence is isolation.'*

> *'To develop your intellectual powers at the expense of the social is to retard your own progress to mastery.'*

> *'Do not build fortresses to protect yourself: isolation is dangerous.'  
'Play the perfect courtier.' -- Robert Greene (4th and 24th law of power)*

Why some people don't like networking?

> *'We don’t like people that see us in a way that doesn’t resonate with how we see ourselves.'*

HINT: How to network? Add value and help people. So find out what people actually want and give it to them.  
We want to form relationships with those who seem like they’ll give at least as much than they take.

[Pay attention](chapter_2_groups.md#on-communication) to what people «say» and [infer](chapter_3_action.md#on-analysis) their goals.  

> *'You'll start to live when you can live outside yourself. Being in the moment instead of being in your head.'*

> *'Social inadequacy AKA creepiness is based on unpredictability.'*

> *'If people forget it wasn't a good network anyway'*

> *'The importance of enthusiasm; the importance of connecting people; expect magic in any encounter'*

> *'Be useful, not important. It’s not about you. It’s about the impact you have on others and the legacy that you leave.'*
Make sure the other person walks away better for having met you.: add value

> *'You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you.' -- Dale Carnegie*

HINT: How to prepare an elevator pitch?  
Personal branding means you are a liar. Truth is a better way to talk about ourselves.  
The story we tell about ourselves to other people is dangerous. Our self-mythology will seduce us.  

you automatically trust when somebody is doing at that time what you're doing. paraphrased scott adams

autenticity

When it comes to the story of our own lives, we’re more like novelists, not journalists. We’re not reading from our confessional journals, but recounting a polished story we’ve rehearsed over years. So a bio becomes a highlight reel of pedigree and accomplishments.

They’d fail to accomplish our goal with a good story, which is to impress, to attract, to reassure, to sell.
Because most of the stories we hear about people’s success are nothing more than clever myth-making: a way of reconfiguring their past as they wish to remember it, shaping it into a compelling and effective narrative, and weaponizing it into a personal propaganda tool.
That story might be Rags to Riches, Rising from the Ashes, One Yes after a Thousand Nos, Crazy Till I Wasn’t, or any one of the familiar narratives we’ve heard from our heroes. authenticity as subtracting the things that get in the way.

> *'Being honest may not get you a lot of friends but it’ll always get you the right ones.' -- John Lennon*

How to taylor/curate a network?

- Networking types: advocates a, boomerang b, celebrities c, drainers d  
shark, dolphin, drowner  
- community of experts (that give you good answers) critical colleagues (10 people that make a big difference in your immediate career) -- boss / boss's boss  
- expand from too dense networks  
- super connectors: people with long networks, spend more time with these people / network on relevant groups that can help you.  
- while drumming up new connections by networking is important, it’s even more important to remember and recognize your connections that already exist. buzz marketing, unlocking dormant ties, long term

HOWEVER: no one’s going to help you in a way that’s prejudicial to them.

<!--

The difference between success and failure can be as simple as keeping in touch

Handle Rejection Gracefully

list the people i met

What if I told you that the best way to get value was to start giving it away? you're giving validation!!

not what should i do next, but who should you speak next?

### On communication

Speak less and listen more.  
Be humble, listening is powerful.

> *'People don’t listen, they just wait for their turn to talk.' -- Chuck Palahniuk*

> *'Listen to many, speak to a few.' -- William Shakespeare*

> *'Listen to predict a collapse.'*

> *'Arguing as you're right. Listening as you're wrong.'*

HINT: How to communicate? 

- listen: listening without worrying about what we’re going to say next. The best conversationalists are the best listeners. Be interested to be interesting, curiosity is king. Active listening.
- smile. the most popular guys smile more than other people and like more other kids.
- don't ramble.  
- look for external catalysts as hints for stories and questions. Understand how to stay tuned in to the conversation by picking up on often-ignored (but crucially important) nonverbal cues. Get better asking questions. They are more important than answers.  
- talk about your passions instead of accomplishments.
- don't be stubborn. You don't always have to get the last word. Make your point and leave it that way. Let go. Is more productive to say «yes and» instead of «yes but». Get rid of ego and add value. Don't judge.

HINT: Some field tactics.

- people that need to be saved
- help the hosters to serve food.
- go to the bar and meet people there
- small and open groups
- Controlling the impression that you make on others takes a large amount of cognitive bandwidth and everything will appear as fake.
- opening line: "hi, I'm X and I dont know anybody in this party." smart flattery  
- best subjects to discuss: ask stuff outside of their expertise where you can add value, travel, sincere compliments And asking for advice.
- Want to Be the Most Interesting Person in the Room? Learn the Art of Active Listening.
- The right question is “How do I get them talking about themselves? It gives their brain as much pleasure as food or money. And when they open up, don’t judge.
- Seek someone else’s thoughts and opinions without judging them.
- Mirroring: Repeat the last 1-3 words the person just said as a question. (Yes, it’s that simple.)
- Paraphrasing: Repeat what they just said in your own words.
Emphasize Similarity, we like people who are like us
- Questions Are Powerful. A great question I love is challenges. “What kind of challenges did you have at work this week? What kind of challenges do you have living in this part of the country? What kinds of challenges do you have raising teenagers?” Everyone has got challenges. It gets people to share what their priorities in life are at that point in time.  
- How to politely end a conversation -> escaping line (you should go on after 10 or 15 minutes. think about it as exploring.):
"excuse me but i must to talk with somebody that entered the room"
"excuse me i have to make a phone call"
human sacrifice.. intro him and leave  
- to rude people: «my mum always told me not to speak with strangers, now i know why»
/ make poeple being interested in you by making them good/unusual questions.
be interested in them to them be interested in you.
- Banish meaningless small talk and learn how to ask questions that build rapport and natural conversation.
- Treat new aquaintances as old friends. Build rapport, cut the BS. Speak what's in your mind, sometimes it backfires, but be real.add value -> give positive energy. The best way to be highly influential is to be human to everyone you meet.  
- «Rescue people instead of «cold calling». Include people to gain allies. Become the conduit in your circle — the one who makes sure introductions are made. It really is as simple as asking, “Have you met my friend, Johnny?” Take that responsibility and welcome strangers into your group, and you’ll help everyone feel like they’re part of the conversation. That’s all anyone wants when they’re out – to feel included.
- be autentic offer good energy, be human, build rapport, listen, humbleness, genuine appreciation
How to make a good first impression: putting your best foot forward actually reveals the real you. smile, When individuals speak slowly and clearly, they tend to sound more credible than those who speak quickly.Stop Trying To Impress research from Harvard shows people would rather work with a lovable fool than a competent jerk -- even if they won’t admit it:

> *'Know how to lead a conversation and how to go with the conversational flow. Get out of your head and become more situationally aware, always looking for external catalysts.'*

> *'Never argue with a fool, onlookers may not be able to tell the difference.' -- Mark Twain*

HINT: How to tell good stories?

A good story does condenses a massive amount of information into a consumable and shareable form. Its primary purpose isn’t accuracy, but entertainment; and when it is accurate, it’s only accurate to the extent that the story requires in order to remain relevant.

> *'Cinema is just life with the boring parts cut out.' -- Alfred Hitchcock*

> *'Storytelling is about the details.'*

<!--
“Think before you speak. Read before you think.” -- Fran Lebowitz

17. Think before you speak. There is always time to add a word, never to withdraw one. Talk as if you were making your will: the fewer words the less litigation. In trivial matters exercise yourself for the more weighty matters of speech. Profound secrecy has some of the lustre of the divine. -- Balthasar Gracian

Don’t explain. People only hear what they want to hear.

How to discord?
> *'Will you tell me your story? I’d love to know how you came to this point of view.'*
> *'I don't have an opinion on that; why don't you tell me how you got to have such a firm one? It sounds like I could learn something.'*

open up question: Why is your best friend, your best friend? You can't fake an answer.
asking questions without paying attention is worthless. you must be curious.
the first question should go to the heart, just than to the head
can be as simple as what is your favourite book?

heart, head and soul in your interview
make the interview feeling safe

Staring isn’t staring if you’re smiling. Or waving. Or if you say hi.

> *'When you listen, you may learn something new.' -- Dalai Lama*
	
Learn how to lessen the crushing pressure of being interesting by focusing on being interested.

> *'You can never be sure who you are dealing with. A man who is of little importance and means today can be a person of power tomorrow.'*

It’s a common belief that your first reaction is the most honest, but I disagree. Your first reaction is usually outdated. Either it’s an answer you came up with long ago and now use instead of thinking, or it’s triggering a knee-jerk emotional response to something that happened long ago. -- Derek Sivers

Don’t talk to someone. Talk with them.

You have to be interested to be interesting. Take an interest in the other person, and they’ll walk away thinking you are interesting.
Ask a question. Listen to the answer. Respond in the form of a statement.

Keep a journal and write about what you’re looking forward to and excited about in life. That’ll keep ideas on the tip of your tongue, ready to discuss. It’s okay to write the same thing over and over each day. The point is to move what’s exciting you to the top of your mental list so you’re ready to go if an opportunity presents.

Calm is largely a matter of slowing your speech down. Warmth comes from smiling while you speak. when you have passion you communicate better

### On business and entrepreneurship

Business exchanges value for money.  
Focus on areas where you are motivated to add value AND there's demand.

> *'What you need to start a new business: generosity.' -- Derek Sivers*

> *'Focus on what can you give instead of focusing in making money. Find your market and you'll get the reward.'*

HINT: Validate your business by finding paying clients.

> *'Without customers, you don’t have a business. You have a hobby.' -- Don Peppers & Martha Rogers*

> *'The consumer votes with his wallet.'*

> *'Test sales first. If something is worth doing, sales will come easy and dollars will be high. If you have to drag people along kicking and screaming, you’re wasting your time. If they were in, they'd be in on day one.'*

> *'In general, it's not about what you know, it's about who trusts you to solve their problems.  
Often, that requires the technical skills to reliably solve their problems.  
Always, that requires the communication skills to persuade someone you can solve their problems.'*

HINTS: on successful *entrepreneurs*.

- Focus on revenue generating activities. If it is not going to earn you money, then don’t do it.  
- You only have to be really right once. History is filled with examples of people like this. Mark Zuckerberg thought that facebook was going to be a college directory and that was it. Bill Gates didn’t think the Internet had any potential. Seriously. They were right about one thing one time and made so much money that it allows them to be consistently wrong over and over again in big ways because their underlying model was right the first time. They had the resources to correct any mistakes and to try a lot of other things, most of which will fail.  
- It’s easier when YOU are the customer. You truly understand the problem.  
- If you have an idea, test it! it’s called putting out a “minimally viable product,” or MVP  
- Create a culture that rewards killing ideas. kill a lot of ideas. There is no risk to our people; nobody gets fired. In fact, people get praised when we kill something. We save a lot of money when we kill a bad idea.  
- Equity unlocks human potential. When people feel like they have ownership in an idea, they can’t stop thinking about it. The more ideas your stakeholders contribute, the better off your chances are at succeeding.  
- TIMING is the most important factor in startup success. Team and Execution came next.
“You really need to look at the signals and be honest about what they are telling you. Go out to market – test if people want your product. If there aren’t enough people, hoard money and conserve momentum.”  
- Successful CEOs are [adaptable and flexible](chapter_3_action.md#on-adapting).
- Do things manually at first. You don’t have to build an elaborate system to get started. Get one client and do everything the hard way. Only after business is over running your ability to do things manually you do have to worry about automation. Don’t put a bunch of effort in on the front end to find out there’s no demand.  
- To make money focus on the fun.
- Scratch your own itch it's good only as a start.
- In some complex and mature markets if you start too small you will never be able to compete with existent players. «Starting up in a garage» works mostly on new and undeveloped markets.
- Successful *entrepreneurs* are good risk managers.
- Launch now  
- Find the 90/10 solution  
- All startups are badly broken at some point  
- Growth is the result of a great product not the precursor  
- Build something people want: Find 10-100 customers who love your product   
- Don’t scale your team/product until you have built something people want  
- Do things that don’t scale  
- Write code – talk to users  
- “It’s not your money”  
- Valuation is not equal to success or even probability of success  
- Avoid long negotiated deals with big customers if you can  
- Avoid big company corporate development queries – they will only waste time  
- Avoid conferences unless they are the best way to get customers  
- Pre-product market fit – do things that don’t scale: remain small/nimble  
- Startups can only solve one problem well at any given time  
- Sometimes you need to fire your customers (they might be killing you)  
- Ignore your competitors, you will more likely die of suicide than murder  
- Most companies don’t die because they run out of money  
- Founder relationships matter more than you think. Be nice! Or at least don’t be a jerk

> *'Sara Blakely used the word «empower» several times. Spanx clothes gives women more confidence. Empowers women. The Belly Art Project empowers pregnant women'*

> *'Be cautious. Entrepreneurs normally take a big risk and offset it with cautious moves (e.g. day job). Entrepreneurs are more risk averse than general population.'
'Entrepreneurs prepare for bad. They budget pessimistically using the worst case scenario.'*

> *'When evaluating an idea make sure the math scales. E.g. If you’re looking for a restaurant location, look at how many seats, average price of meal, average turnover time, multiply it out. Will even max capacity pay the rent? How many potential sales, how much does it cost to reach them, what is a conversion rate to expect? How much can you produce in an hour, will that ever pay you enough?'*

> *'Startup fortune cookie: that company that seems so interested in buying you won't.'*

<!--
> *'I think the role of the entrepreneur in the world is to find ways to do things better or more efficiently and then try to do that as many times over with the help of other people.' -- Santiago Nestares*

Fall in love with the problem, not the solution.

You're a wannapreneur if:
- You talk to people about your ideas, but never build anything
- You build something without first talking to people
- You build something and never try to sell it
If you build something that people say they'll pay for and then they don't actually pay for it then this is problematic, but also normal and doesn't make you a wannapreneur. At that point it's just part of the struggle. -- Alex3917

“Make something people will buy from you”

overdesign / don't start from scratch / Throw Shit at the Wall and See What Sticks. Life is about experimenting.

The disruptor’s credo, say it with me: Your profit margin is my opportunity. 
Friend of a friend owns a small chain of grocery stores in New Jersey. A few years ago, when Amazon got into groceries, he changed his mind about investing in the growth of his own business. He started buying Amazon shares with his investment capital instead. He saw what happened to Circuit City and Tower Records, Borders and Barnes & Noble. So he bought some Amazon and then he bought some more.
This wasn’t retirement investing. This was something else. What should we call it? Disruption Insurance?
	
when you dont have the monopoly, all markets are like online dating, people need to fall in love with our ideas. cretaivity doesnt operate in the vacuum. rivals and _distraction_ are your compettion. you need to seel your ideas.

I’m proud to announce to you that I’m a problem solver and business creator.

Nate has grown and sold several businesses, and he’s found that there’s a critical tipping point in each business (typically when it hits $5,000,000 in revenue) where he begins to burn out and lose interest.
Instead of fighting this, he’s adopted the “Serial Entrepreneur” approach and will sell his equity or the entire business, once a project passes a certain revenue threshold.

Jeff Bezos summed this up when he said “Your margin is my opportunity.”
The key to business and investing success isn’t finding an advantage. It’s having a sustainable advantage. Something that others either can’t or aren’t willing to copy once your idea is exposed and patents expire.

social adeptness is balancing two seemingly opposing social strategies: competing and cooperating

É por isso que não tenho patrão, para não me cortarem a criatividade. -- Cesar Borja
	
The more people pay for something, the more they value it.

One of my favorite pg ideas: "When something is described as a toy, that means it has everything an idea needs except being important. It's cool; users love it; it just doesn't matter. But if you're living in the future and you build something cool that users love, it may matter more than outsiders think."

I'm not surprised that high-end retail is still doing fine. People want the luxury purchasing experience to be luxurious -- they'd rather buy their luxury goods in boutiques than get them delivered in a cardboard box from Amazon.
Part of that may simply be wariness about spending a lot of money on stuff that's going to be shipped and could be lost, but that's not all. Owning the luxury goods themselves is only part of the experience -- being treated well during the purchase and during future customer service interactions is a big part of the draw of luxury items. You don't get that from most online retailers.

Start with something I'm interested in. Don't worry about the theory; just focus on solving the problem. Solve the problem; start broadening my focus from there. <- on learning programming

For example, if you’re an entrepreneur who opens a coffee shop, you’ll have a lot of ways you can make money. You can sell coffee, cakes, paintings, merchandise, and more. But each of those things will not contribute to your success in an equal way. While there is value in the discovery process, once you’ve found the variable that matters most, you should place more time on that one and less on the others. The importance of finding this variable cannot be overstated.
	
HINT: Money is energy and the expression of your creativity.

Moonshot: 10X bigger instead of 10%. imply a new process not an optimization.
Aiming for something that is 10x better vs 10% better is 100 times more worth it… but never 100 times harder.

Raising money:
The problem is that investors are too easy when it comes to giving second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth chances... And they absolutely suck at giving first chances to the right people. Investors just sit there and assume that the right people will find them, but they don't.
The right people are too busy working to be chasing down investors 24/7.
The first-timers who end up getting funded over and over again are usually the ones who network 24/7 and their only real talent is seducing investors who confuse their well-rehearsed talk for passion and intelligence.

startups are similar to biological life. Wherever the conditions are hospitable, life already exists.
The difference is that startups live in an economic rather than a biological environment. -> funds dont mind that u fail if they have also some winners

1) Do networking and listen. It's not about how great you are in your wildest dreams.
2) Deliver a little bit more than expected. That'll help to get you some recommendations.
3) Don't follow every new tech stack, framework whatsoever hype. Choose your toolchain where you are feeling comfortable with.
4) Raise your hourly rate. There's nothing wrong with it, if you're doing a great job based on past projects.
5) Say "No" to nasty, time consuming and time wasting clients.
6) Build your own brand to be proud of.

The biggest assumption I ever made in business is that most people are telling me the truth. Most people have no idea what truth is.

Fire customers that cause you to much stress or that cost too much to service.

give where you are naturally good
quick to start but not the first

failing business -> fire 60% top managers (ricardo semler)
process of asking 3 whys is a row -> the first why is easy to answer

There’s the myth that failure makes you a better entrepreneur. This is FALSE. study your failures.

Changes in the environment unlock startup opportunities.
startup ideas -> problems and trends

There are two types of entrepreneurs: Missionaries and mercenaries.

disney salvation:
1. Create a Clear, Simple Vision (Your Corporate MTP). -> deleverage
2. Make long-term bets.
3. Make fearless acquisitions on the edge.

i recall reading that someone had more success with a "unlock feature X" model of payment, even though it in total was more expensive than unlocking everything at once.
people underestimate the power of free. trusted to one day pay me. send an email to all readers saying that i'm making consultations.
there's a price for it always. everything is an exchange. you can achieve everything but there is a price.
people don't achieve anything because they are not willing to sacrifice. everything is a trade.

There is a golden rule, long cherished by restaurateurs, for determining whether a business is viable. Rent should take up no more than 25 percent of your revenue, another 25 percent should go toward payroll, and 35 percent should go toward the product. The remaining 15 percent is what you take home. There's an even more elegant version of that rule: Make your rent in four days to be profitable, a week to break even. If you haven't hit the latter mark in a month, close.

You Have to Beat Your “Hopium” Addiction
If you want to wean yourself off this potent “substance” the first step is to cultivate a sense of positive skepticism.
“How could this decision negatively affect my financial future and stability.”

It's not even about marketing, just building something of actual value. I doubt this girl has spent much if anything on marketing.

zona genius: only 3 things I'm allowed to do in my business, the things that really serve us and we good at it
top 5 list you do, the rest is avoid at all cost list.
genius area / excellence area / competence area / incompetence area

hot to make, how to keep, how to grow money

there's not a lot competition neither a lot of people looking for change. our biggest competitor is indifference and inaction. people are already solving their problems, better or worse. very few people are always researching for something better.

Learn to provide relative value on a massive scale and you will become rich
three things make anything possible: People, technology and money.

### On selling, negotiation and price

We're all in sales anytime we interact with anybody.  
To sell is to deal with objections.

Best sellers are now ambiverts.  
Sales used to be about information asymmetry but times are changing.  
Now it's mostly [applied persuasion](chapter_3_action.md#on-charming) and keeping relationships.

> *'Traditional selling: extroverts -> cold calling -> tech made it more difficult  
Intruding (to get your foot in the door)  
Pitching (to persuade the customer to buy)  
Persisting (to push until you make the sale)'*

> *'Effective selling: ambiverts and introverts -> we don't need hunters, just farmers  
Research (to understand the customer - time spent alone on the Web, reading and analyzing information)  
Listening (to understand individual needs - being patient and quiet while remaining open to new ideas and perspectives)  
Reacting (to adapt to the identified needs - letting the other person set the pace and the agenda)'*

> *'Instead of details use interesting testimonials that allow people to relate.'*

HINTS:

> *'If they can’t pay, walk away.'*

> *'Marketing is a symptom not of excess consumption but of excess production.'*

> *'People don’t buy products, they buy better versions of themselves.'*

> *'Females buy male products. Males don't buy products targetted to females.'*

> *'Go into job interviews with a story in mind. All an interviewer really wants to know is if he can spend eight hours a day around you.'*

HINT: Negotiation establishes the price (exchange rate between money and value).
That said, a bad/good negotiation means that you are adding more/less value than receiving for it.

> *'You don’t get what you deserve in life, you only get what you negotiate.'*

> *'Pay too much for everything. The effort spent getting a deal is only a distraction and attention is your most limited resource.' -- Allen Tucker*

HINT: To negotiate is to have options.  
Negotiate while advancing. The more you take, the more you can give back in meaningless concessions.

> *'Control the options: get others to play with the cards you deal.' -- Robert Greene (31st law of power)*

> *'When people feel they have a choice, they walk into your trap that much more easily.'*

> *'When asking for help, appeal to people’s self-interest, never to their mercy or gratitude.' -- Robert Greene (13th law of power)*

«What’s your best out-the-door price?»
«Can you do X% below that?»
«If you can reach my price, I’ll buy today.»

- Never negotiate with binary questions: '«What can you do?» instead of «Will you do this?»'  
- How to say no? «How am I supposed to do that?». «How» gives people an opportunity to show how smart they are.'

Tone of voice is a big clue to know with whom we are negotiating:

> *'The analytical cold guy is very patient;  
The assertive guy (eg. Trump) wants to make it fast;  
For the accomodator, the relationship is the most important'*

> *'People may or may not say what they mean,” he explained, “but they always say something designed to get what they want.' -- David Mamet*

> *'On negotiation you don't need to match the other person mood, you should be playful and smart, taking the other to mirror your good mood also.'*

> *'Mirroring and reword. repeating the last one to three words of the other person. It opens up people's brain. Its' very effective. Test the firmness of what they want. People didn't even realize it.'*

HOWEVER... always strive to achieve a win-win situation. The deal will fall if both sides don't take what they need from it.

> *'Peace cannot be kept by force. It can only be achieved by understanding.' -- Albert Einstein*

> *'You can’t make a good deal with a bad person.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'The most dangerous negotiation is the one you don’t know you’re in.'*

<!--
- how to say no: When processing a “yes” or “no” to a request, don’t forget about your third option: negotiation.
- how to say no to an interview: i think i said already everthing about that subject.
- how to say no to something else: i think i did already what i can do.

- There is no such thing as "shortage" of anything. Just pay more, and you'll get it.

What’s the best way to sell anything? Show arbitrage: If they pay X, now they are buying something worth X * Y. That is the ONLY way to sell

27. Don’t make a man feel too indebted to you. With many persons it is not necessary to do more than overburden them with favours to lose them altogether: they cannot repay you, and so they retire, preferring rather to be enemies than perpetual debtors. The idol never wishes to see before him the sculptor who shaped him, nor does the benefited wish to see his benefactor always before his eyes. -- Balthasar Gracian

always negotiate. dont communicate weaknes on your negotiation.
your first reaction should be no reaction. fight impulse to imediatelly give the answer.

I appreciate the consideration and the offer. I truly enjoyed our conversation and feel great about the team and company. [Reiterate passion; set the tone.]

I need to evaluate this based on other opportunities I am looking at and will get back to you shortly. [Display social proof/market validation.] As I am doing that it would be helpful to know if there is any flexibility in the terms? [Put them on the defensive.]

I look forward to your response. [Power close.]

Cheers,

Letter Two [Counteroffer]
Bob, [First name: power play.]

I appreciate the consideration and the offer. [A meaningless courtesy that doesn’t do much, but when it isn’t there, people notice.] I am very excited about the team, the product and the direction of the company. I know I can make a big impact on the organization. [Reiterate passion and set the tone for the back-and-forth. Also a power play.]

Based on other opportunities I am looking at, I feel xxx,xxx,xxx.xx is a fair number for what I can bring to ______. [12%-15% above the offer is optimal. Higher, and you risk insulting them or pricing yourself out of the job. Lower and you could be leaving money on the table.] If you can match that I am ready to sign today and will give my notice tomorrow. [This is the most important part. Present a slam dunk and dare them not to take it. You are coming over the top with enthusiasm; it’s a power play and almost always pays off.]

I look forward to your response. [Power play; leave them with good vibes.]

Cheers,
Alex “Dream Employee” Kouts

Review:

Always use first names (caveat: unless their title vastly exceeds yours — if they’re on LinkedIn, use how they address themselves there as a reference.)
Never make the first offer.
Thank them.
Set the tone for the negotiation.
Display social proof/market validation.
Set your “ask.”
Help them visualize the win.
Reiterate interest and close strong.
Negotiating for a Car/Motorcycle/Mattress
Alex shrewdly picked up a mattress for his girlfriend — plus a box spring, plus a frame — for less than half of what the salesman was originally asking for the mattress alone. Here’s his list of things you can say or do when negotiating for something like a car, motorcycle, or mattress — keep this handy on your phone so you can put it to use next time you’re trying to get a good deal!

First establish a baseline — use Google.
Ask if they will match advertised prices from a competitor.
“What is your best out the door price?”
“Will you do that -10%?”
“If you reach my price, I will buy today.”
“I am on the phone with xxxx; they have this advertised for $xxxx. Can you beat that?”
“If I buy here, will you throw in xxxx?”
“What if I pay cash?”
“Okay, thank you. It’s helpful to know where you stand. I am going to check out a couple of your competitors and will be back if it makes sense.”
WALK AWAY.

I'm on a mix of hourly and value based, will try to change from 50/50 to 10/90 in favor of value based next year.

creative pricing:
One time a college far away in Ohio, about a 12-hour drive, asked what I would charge to do a two-hour show.
I said, “$1500”. She said, “Oh, that’s a bit too much. What would you charge to do just a one-hour show?”
I said, “$2000”. She said, “No, wait, you’ll be performing less, not more!”
I said, “Yeah! Exactly! What you’re paying me for is to get there! Once I’m there, playing music is the fun part! If you tell me I have to get back in the van after only an hour, and drive home, then I’m going to charge you more than if you let me play for a couple hours first.”
She liked that so much she came up with the $1500.

on negotiation if you want to go fast, let the other part go first.
	
> *'You don’t convince people by challenging their longest and most firmly held opinions. You find common ground and work from there. Or you look for leverage to make them listen. Or you create an alternative with so much support from other people that the opposition voluntarily abandons its views and joins your camp.' -- Ryan Holiday, The Obstacle Is the Way*

REMeMBER PEOPLE THAT THEY HAVE CHOICES, That they can control.

never split the difference

Negotiate contracts in minute detail on the front end so that you aren’t negotiating after work is done, investments are made, and you have no bargaining power. This is especially important if the relationship between people is important as it avoids conflict later on.

make an agreement on a standard of value.
my standard of value for a weekend: some combination of rejuvenation and human connection.
normally we fall into habits. we don't do what is best for ourselves.
people have different standards of value: weekend example
rejuvenation and human conception will derail to your habits.

Alex says you can even create a worksheet for yourself by asking clear and direct questions like:

What am I negotiating?
What is my timeline? (This will affect your urgency.)
Who are the parties involved? (Asking questions will ensure you are dealing with the decision-maker.)
What are my interests in this particular case?

when asked for a number:
“I’m looking at a few different offers and opportunities — what were you thinking?”

When you do get an offer, Alex recommends not counteroffering immediately. “Say thank you for the offer and that you are grateful for the opportunity, and then ask if there is any flexibility on the base.

A great closing line: “Based on other opportunities, if you can match this (salary) I can give notice tomorrow.”

Alex points out that he wouldn’t hire someone who would simply accept the first offer he gives.

> *'Marketers don’t convince. Engineers convince. Marketers persuade. Persuasion appeals to the emotions and to fear and to the imagination. Convincing requires a spreadsheet or some other rational device.' -- Seth Godin*

It’s much easier to persuade someone if they’re already convinced, if they already know the facts. But it’s impossible to change someone’s mind merely by convincing them of your point.

Call all owners to rent. 8 said yes. Then auction! 2200 -> 1500

To sell, you have to understand personalities, you have to learn what excites people, you have to over deliver, you have to understand competitors, etc.
Business is 80% psychological.

irritation -> challenge people to make something that they don't want to do
agitation -> challenge people to make something that they want to do. suggesting ego etc
agitate more than irritate

So can you pitch me what our company does?

### On relationships

Relationships are based on mutual trust.  
Trust and vulnerability are conected.

> *'A great relationship is about finding the similarities and respect the differences.'*

> *'Focus on what you can give not what you can get. You only receive in proportion to what you give.'*

> *'Trust someone if they say they are human and susceptible to conflicts of interest but actively avoiding such conflicts.'*

> *'Trust bank account analogy: you make deposits by being on time, doing what you say you will, random acts of kindness, etc. You make withdrawals by being flaky, forgetful, and insensitive, among other things.'*

HOWEVER... after taking the first step [mirror](chapter_3_action.md#on-mirroring) their behavior.  
Run away from mediocrity and be ready to loose people.

> *'Don't hide your feelings from people who show you theirs.'*

> *'Forget those who forget you. Those who want to stay in your life, will always find a way.'*

> *'If you are lonely when you are not alone, you are in bad company.'*

> *'Humans make connections. Sometimes these connections grow. Sometimes they stay the same. Sometimes they collapse.'*

> *'The free soul is rare, but you know it when you see it -- basically because you feel good, very good, when you are near or with them.' -- Charles Bukowski*

> *'If a person is nice to you and to nobody else, that person is not nice.'*

> *'You loose your identity, you loose people.' -- Amy Cuddy*

> *'Don't let people that are bad influences to put you down.'*

> *'I won’t be less just because you cannot be more'*

<!--
Again, something I once wrote on the subject of a good partnership was “Shared values and complementary skills.”
So I think it’s very important to share values, but I also think it’s important to not be the same person, a copy of yourself. If it’s a copy of yourself, you don’t need it.
	
14. Earn respect before demanding it. Do not enforce respect, but try and create it. Those who insist on the dignity of their office, show they have not deserved it, and that it is too much for them. If you wish to be valued, be valued for your talents, not for anything adventitious. Even kings prefer to be honoured for their personal qualifications rather than for their station. -- Balthasar Gracian

first we judge trust, before strength.
we build trust through presence. leadership is based on trust.

There are four types of relationships with people:
Win Win (long term), Win Lose, Lose Win, Lose Lose

### On lovers

You attract what you are.  

HINTS:

> *'If you are struggling in your relationships, odds are, you are withholding your truth from your woman.
You need to open up, tell her the truth, be honest with her without fear of outcome and without any neediness from her.'*

> *'On a serious conversation with a SO, instead of generalizing, talk about three things:  
First, your observations, or what you have noticed is happening in your relationship.  
Next talk about how the observation has made you feel. Finally, discuss your values.'*

> *'For a long and deep relationship, values must match.' -- EF*

> *'Keep separate bank accounts. Spouses should have the freedom and autonomy to buy what they want, but only after bills are automatically paid. People value things differently. Having to justify every expense makes you feel like you’re being watched. This breeds resentment. Most marriages end in divorce, most of them over money.'* 

Run away from lovers who treats you like you're ordinary.  
You need to partner with someone who wants you to be all you can be.

> *'Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength, while loving someone deeply gives you courage.' -- Lao Tzu*

> *'Every person feels loved in a different form.'*

> *'Love doesn’t hurt. Expectations do.'*

HINT: There comes a time when you have to stop crossing oceans for people who wouldn’t even jump puddles for you.  

> *'Men experience many passions in a lifetime. One passion drives away the one before it.' -- Paul Newman*

HOWEVER...

> *'Love me when I least deserve it, because that's when I really need it.' -- Swedish proverb*

> *'The love that lasts the longest is the love that is never returned' -- W. Somerset Maugham*

> *'Love is what happens to men and women that don't know each other.'*

### On family and friends

Life is meant to be lived in community.  

HINT: build your «board of directors». However choose who surrond you: you are the average of them. 

- Surround yourself with mentors and friends who are achieving on a higher level than you who are willing to call you out on your failures and lift you up for your successes. Once you build this infrastructure of support and accountability, your life will radically transform.  
If you want to improve your bank account, get around millionaires.
If you want to improve your body, befriend competitive athletes
If you want to improve your love life, go hang out with the town “Casanova”.
When you are intentional about surrounding yourself with the right people, you will find every area of your life accelerating.
Jim Rohn said it best, “You are the average of the five people you spend your time with most.”
If you spend the majority of your time in worlds where people are accomplishing incredible things, all of a sudden that starts to seem normal.  
- You're never too old to make a friend. Always be looking for a new one. If a buddy calls and needs to get a drink, go. No matter the hour, how busy you are, or what else you have going on.

> *'If you're the smartest in the room, you're in the wrong room.'*

> *'Your friends are the ones that go to your funeral in a day of rain.'*

> *'Infection: avoid the unhappy and unlucky.' -- Robert Greene (10th law of power)*

HINT: you will waste your life trying to make those around into who you want them to be.

> *'When you enter a workplace, think that you will become like them and not the opposite.'*

There comes a time in life when you’ll have to leave everything behind and start something new but never forget the ones who stood by your side, especially the ones who never let you let go.

- Cleave from your family but then come back. You need to be independent and loyal at the same time.

> *'Our mothers always remain the strangest, craziest people we've ever met.' -- Marguerite Duras*

HINT: resist to temptation of working with family and friends. There will be always problems of fixing hierarchy when working with friends. Peers are peers, not boss and employee. Keep your friends for friendship, work with the skilled and competent.  

> *'Never put too much trust in friends, learn how to use enemies.' -- Robert Greene (2nd law of power)*

<!--
> *'When everything goes to hell, the people who stand by you without flinching -- they are your family.' -- Jim Butcher*

26. Friendships change. Trust the friends of today as if they will be enemies tomorrow, and that of the worst kind. As this happens in reality, let it happen in your precaution. -- Balthasar Gracian

22. Don’t befriend fools. He that does not know a fool when he sees him is one himself: still more he that knows him but will not keep clear of him.
They are dangerous company and ruinous confidants. -- Balthasar Gracian

3. Don’t succumb to the collective flaws of your peers. Avoid the Faults of your Nation. Water shares the good or bad qualities of the strata through which it flows, and man those of the climate in which he is born.  -- Balthasar Gracian

i wanted to make part of the group, but that group is made of broken people. than you realise that is too stressful.

its the tribe that you dont want to belong but you are.

Everyone loves you when you’re a winner. But you know who your true friends are when you’re still a nobody.

pedestals prevent friendships

> *'Undisturbed calmness of mind is attained by cultivating friendliness toward the happy, compassion for the unhappy, delight in the virtuous, and indifference toward the wicked.' -- Patanjali*

Remember that sometimes people wind up in our lives not because we judged them as high-quality individuals, but because of circumstance and nothing more.
we choose friends by proximity, not how do we feel around them, is him as invested in my well being than i am in his.
focus in others people sucess but pick the right people.

One time I had a friend who consistently would put me down. Or find reasons to be upset at me whenever something good was happening in my life.
The key to success in any relationship: personal, familial, business, etc is NOT that the two people are supportive during bad times but that the two people are supportive during GOOD times.

I also know someone is a friend when I can go long stretches without talking to him or her and then we talk and its right where we left off. I have a lot of friends like that.

look for people with the same interests as you: meetup, learn a new skill
second step is inviting them to do something.

Every employee should eventually leave and start a better competitor to me. Everyone should pass me. Else I’m not the stupidest person in the room.

### On feedback and mentorship

Feedback speeds up improvement.  
But only take advice from mentors. They are the best source of feedback.

> *'I’d rather have criticism from a genius than praise from an idiot.'*

> *'A coach spots your bullshit before you open your mouth.'*

> *'Follow the thought leaders instead of the traffic leaders.'*

> *'Really great people make you feel that you too can be great.' -- Mark Twain*

> *'He who asks is a fool for five minutes, but he who does not ask remains a fool forever.' -- Chinese proverb*

HINT: How to find mentors?

> *'Find mentors to help you improve, even virtual mentors as a good book.'*

> *'Don’t follow your mentors; follow your mentors’ mentors.' -- David Leach*

> *'When looking for a mentor, look for the silver medalist. He has more availability, and sometimes, a better attitude than «the golden child».'*

> *'Your father is your first mentor.'*

<!--
> *'Everyone seems to have a clear idea of how other people should lead their lives, but none about his or her own.' -- Paulo Coelho*

> *'No, that is the great fallacy: the wisdom of old men. They do not grow wise. They grow careful.' -- Ernest Hemingway*

I don't have the time to explain the logic behind my wisdom. I can only show you the door as my conclusions are avenues you obviously haven't explored. It's up to you whether you want to take the blue pill or the red pill.

> *'Build your Board of Directors. Mentors and friends who are achieving on a higher level than you who are willing to call you out on your failures and lift you up for your successes. Once you build this infrastructure of support and accountability, your life will radically transform.'*

> *'Find somebody smarter to teach you, somebody equal to challenge you and somebody less developed that you can teach.'*

> *'Surround yourself with people who challenge you to be better, not people who are enamored with who you already are.'*
-->

Be [generous](/chapter_2_groups.md#on-rewards-and-generosity) and share your strengths. Impact the world.  
When you teach, you do something useful. When you do research, most days you don’t.

> *'Service to others is the rent you pay for your room here on Earth.' -- Muhammad Ali*

> *'One repays a teacher badly if one remains only a pupil.' -- Nietzsche*

> *'Powerful people give freely, buying influence rather than things.'*

> *'A society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit in.' -- Greek proverb*

> *'If you think you're too small to make an impact, try to go to bed with a mosquito in the room.'*

> *'The best way to cheer yourself up is to try to cheer someone else up.' -- Mark Twain*

> *'Play on people’s need to believe to create a cult-like following.' -- Robert Greene (27th law of power)*

<!--
the value of getting a coach. spend more time fixing weaknesses than developing strengths!

the way of man is the way of the gang

Actually, the last time I saw my uncle, I asked how he could be generous, and yet not be taken advantage of or stuck with horrible people.
He said that what he'd learned to do was to condition whatever help he was offering on the person taking some tiny step first. Often, it was as simple as "make up a budget for you and your wife to go on a three day getaway, send it to me, and I'll write you a check." He said that almost everyone who was just in it for the handouts couldn't be bothered.
My uncle also mixed a lot of his giving with encouraging young people's talents. He'd hire students who were excited in X, to do X for him in some way. He hired students to take photos, make music, decorate houses, build apps, archive things, paint, and who knows what else. He even hired a student to make memes. This way the students not only got money, but grew in their skills and were excited that someone wanted their work.
There were, of course, some rude and uncaring people in his life. But those people didn't want to spend time with him so there was never really a conflict there.

One of the reasons why I think your uncle's gestures made such a big impact is that he made gestures that rewarded good things AND he wasn't a relative to many of the people he interacted with.

Everyone has investment advice. Health advice (no “gluten!”). Money advice (“401ks!”), Education advice (“Harvard!”). Career advice (“Wall Street!”), etc.
They are only telling you their dreams.

But that's the point of this whole post: If you can't justify being nice for the sake of others, at least be nice for the sake of yourself. It'll work out well for others. some people are takers and lack the reflex to give.

Fatherhood makes you a mentor independently of your will. Learn how to give advice.

> *'I don't tell my boys them how to live. I live fully and let them see.'*

> *'The best gift you can give your children is failure'*

HINTS: How to teach your kids...

- generosity: «What did u do this week for somebody?»  
- responsability: «Bedtime at 8.30 and I turn off the light or 9 and you have the responsability to turn off the light?»  
- self improvement: «Did u give your best today?» «Ask good questions today. In future you’ll be able to know anything you want, anytime you want. So the quality of the questions you learn to ask will be more important than memorized knowledge.»  
- autority: «Kid: why do i have to do this? You: I was a boy myself. I know what is that for you and why is important.»  
- money management and healthy habits: pay your son for each mile he rides his bike (with interest on what he decides not to spend).  
- fight perfectionism: «If you get a C or lower, I’ll buy you a present. If you score higher than that, I won’t buy you anything, because you won’t need it.»  
- deal with failure: «How did you fail today?»  
- optimism: «You have the gift of today.»

HOWEVER... some people are not ready to have a mentor and accept your vision.  
And «givers» attract «takers». Don't let them drain you, you [don't owe them](#on-freedom) anything.

### On rewards and generosity

Always be generous: a low value gift can have the opposite effect.

> *'Negative reinforcement isn’t as effective as positive reinforcement -- even for people. Punishment only works near the situation that did that to you.'*

> *'Always give best in class: practical luxuries make better gifts than merchandise branded with your company’s logo.'*

> *'He that gives should never remember and he that receives should never forget.'*

HINT: punish VS reward

continuous reinforcement |> intermitent reinforcement

the power of punishment to suppress behavior usually disappears when the threat of punishment is removed
punishment often triggers a fight-or-flight response and renders us aggressive
punishment inhibits the ability to learn new and better responses
punishment is often applied unequally

There are three alternatives that you can try the next time you feel tempted to punish someone.
extintion of rewards
positively reinforcing preferred activities.
prompting and shaping are two actions we can use together to change behavior in an iterative manner. A prompt is a cue or stimulus that encourages the desired behavior. When shaping begins, any approximation of the target response is reinforced.

power of incentives: Ignoring incentives almost never works out well
Psychologists argue that the best way for us to learn complex behaviors is via continuous reinforcement, in which the desired behavior is reinforced every time it’s performed.

<!--

> *'No one has ever become poor by giving.' -- Anne Frank*

Generosity without Expectation is Sexy
It means that your thoughts, words, and actions are all in congruence.
you don’t live a life that is incongruent with what you want to make others happy.
You live a life of congruence where everything is in line.
This is the pathway to true power.

Be generous from a place of abundance, where you are giving because you are already so full, not from a place of scarcity where you are kind because you want something in return.

The people who love you most can care less about how much money you make or what gifts you can send them. What they really want is your time, presence and attention.

# 2.2 - On interaction: drawbacks

### On conflicts

Don't avoid *relevant* conflicts. Small conflicts will grow into big conflicts.  
Neutrality is not possible. Anyway preserve your [freedom](chapter_1_self.md#on-freedom).

> *'Avoiding conflict will not keep peace, will rot it.  
Rotten peace builds resentment.' -- EF*

> *'I am either part of the solution or part of the problem.'*

> *'Well-kept gardens die by pacifism.'*

HINTS on conflict resolution:

- Offer value from the start: Set the stage by coming in smiling. Pay a compliment, make a joke, shake hands, or give a high five to get the interaction off to a friendly start.  
- Take responsibility  
- Show some empathy  
- Use “we” to show you’re on the same team  
- Bring options to the table: an high-value person always knows what they want before they come to the table. They also understand that it’s much easier to negotiate down

### On criticism and envy

Treat your haters like toddlers.

Outliers inspire envy. [Intelligence](chapter_appendix.md#on-intelligence), [wealth](chapter_appendix.md#on-wealth), [ambition](chapter_appendix.md#on-ambition-and-motivation), [fame](chapter_appendix.md#on-fame), [luck](/chapter_appendix.md#on-luck), [beauty](chapter_appendix.md#on-beauty), [health](chapter_appendix.md#on-stress-and-health), freedom and a mix of them ([lifestyle](chapter_appendix.md#on-lifestyle)) are the main triggers. 

> *'Great spirits have always found violent opposition from mediocrities. The latter cannot understand it when a man does not thoughtlessly submit to hereditary prejudices but honestly and courageously uses his intelligence.' -- Albert Einstein*

> *'They called her witch because she knew how to heal herself.'*

> *'Think as you like but behave like others.'  
'Never appear too perfect.' -- Robert Greene (38th and 46th law of power)*

> *'Have exactly one vice. Two is too much. None makes you boring. Drink cocktails. Beer is for uncreative people.'*

When people criticize your life they are speaking about their fears and limitations not yours.  
Only take advice from [those achieving what you want to achieve](chapter_1_self.md#on-feedback). Ignore and be flattered by the rest.

### On following the herd

Most people are other people. Their thoughts are someone else opinions and they jump to conclusions.

> *'Common sense is the collection of prejudices acquired by age eighteen.'*

> *'People accept the defaults very easily.'*

> *'Gold rushes make the shovel sellers rich, not the gold seekers.'*

> *'Nothing is more terrible than to see ignorance in action.' -- Goethe*

> *'Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by neglect.' -- Hanlon’s Razor*

> *'Everyone is born a genius, but the process of living de-geniuses them.' -- Buckminster Fuller*

> *'Just because people tell you it can’t be done, that doesn’t necessarily mean that it can’t be done. It just means that they can’t do it.' -- Anders Hejlsberg*

> *'In individuals, insanity is rare; but in groups, parties, nations and epochs, it is the rule.' -- Friedrich Nietzsche*

HOWEVER... smart people don’t think others are stupid and common sense is not so common.

> *'Taking a fence down without knowing why is there.'*

> *'There are no smart people or stupid people, just people being smart or being stupid. Being smart means thinking things through -- trying to find the real answer, not the first answer. Being stupid means avoiding thinking by jumping to conclusions. Jumping to a conclusion is like quitting a game: you lose by default.That’s why saying «I don’t know» is usually smart, because it’s refusing to jump to a conclusion. So when someone says «They are so stupid!» -- it means they’ve stopped thinking.'*

> *'I find for myself that my first thought is never my best thought. My first thought is always someone else's; it's always what I've already heard about the subject, always the conventional wisdom.' -- William Deresiewicz*

most people don't actually think. They just take their first thought and go.	

Two economists are walking along the street, and one says, “Hey, someone dropped a $20 bill!” and the other says, “Well, it can’t be a real $20 bill because someone would have picked it up already.”
	
From Scott Adams (Dilbert):
> Rational People: Use data and reason to arrive at truth. (This group is mostly imaginary.)
> Word-Thinkers: Use labels, word definitions, and analogies to create the illusion of rational thinking. This group is 99% of the world.
> Persuaders: Use simplicity, repetition, emotion, habit, aspirations, visual communication, and other tools of persuasion to program other people and themselves. This group is about 1% of the population and effectively control the word-thinkers of the world.

3 types of man: spectators, the dabblers and the men in the arena.

As humans, we are tribal by nature. Our natural default is to see ourselves as part of some group that’s struggling against some other group(s) at all times. And once we’re part of our little group, our little tribe, we adopt all sorts of biases and preferences. We construct belief systems that justify our group’s power and superiority. We create tests of whether other people are “true” and “pure” members of our group, and we either shame any “non-believers” into conformity or simply expel them from the tribe.

Once a philosophy goes tribal, its beliefs no longer exist to serve some moral principle, but rather they exist to serve the promotion of the group.

But the problem is that, like I said, feminism, in the process of enacting all of the progress of the last 50 years, became more than a philosophy—it became an institution. And institutions are always primarily interested in sustaining themselves first and engaging with the world as it is second.

The way you destroy stereotypes is by being the contradiction of the stereotype. These are the real activists. This is where real progress happens. Yes, women still face stereotypes and poor treatments in these industries. But this is the trench today’s feminists should be fighting in. This is where they should be making their push -- and not by talking about it online, but by actually being there.

Tribal feminists, in the name of fighting shame and oppression, shame and oppress views that contradict their own.

And once your philosophy has inverted upon itself, it becomes corrupt. Just like the old communist societies of the 20th century, once you set out to provide perfect equality for everybody, you achieve the exact opposite. What was once progressive becomes regressive. You become so busy policing people’s thoughts and opinions that you lose track of what actually matters.

# 2.3 - On teams

### On leadership

Leaders are team makers.  
Being a leader is different from being a boss. Leadership is based on mutual [trust](#on-relationships).

> *'A leader is best when people barely know he exists, when his work is done, his aim fulfilled, they will say: we did it ourselves.' -- Lao Tzu*

> *'If you want to lead, simply act with confidence and others around you will pick up on that energy and fall in line. No explicit statements needed. If someone fails to fall in line, either your leadership needs improvement or you need to excise them from your group.'*

> *'Be royal in your own fashion: act like a king to be treated like one.' -- Robert Greene (34th law of power)*

> *'The only thing that gives orders is balls.' -- Tony Montana*

Being a leader requires to be equal parts manager and psychotherapist.

> *'There are no bad teams, only bad leaders.'*

> *'The secret to motivating people and maintaining their morale is to get them to think less about themselves and more about the group.'*

> *'People don't follow robots.'*

People want leadership because they want autonomy and influence.

> *'The person who clears the path ultimately controls its direction, just as the canvas shapes the painting.' -- Ryan Holiday*

> *'Influence is more powerful than money. The reason millionaires are depressed is that they don’t know the difference.'*

> *'You have to be the boss or you have to play ball.'*

HINTS:

HOWEVER... Be humble.

> *'Keep your attempts at intimidation under control. Be careful not to become intoxicated by the power fear brings.'*

> *'I’m not here to help; I’m here to learn.'*

> *'No one is smarter than a small group.'*

- power is having options than you can metabolize. Power is making decisions

- leadership i sthe ability to locate yourself. sleep walking through life. self awareness is the ability to pause mind 

> *'Praise by name, criticize by category.' -- Warren Buffet*

you are a leader to somebody.leaders must be good followers. good leaders are leaders that grow up in the hierarchy.

In order to be successful you will probably have to build a team of successful people to support you. You need them to be paid well and well taken care of. You must make it easy for them to succeed and you must teach them how to do it. You won’t do it alone. Put employees before customers. Owners make more than employees in the long run.

We advance the welfare of others — often unconsciously — by sharing resources, cooperating, and collaborating within a social structure. As perhaps an unintended consequence, we find ourselves gaining power. Most often, this power is something that’s given to us, and not something we set out to seize. This runs directly counter to the popular belief that power is attained by becoming a Machiavellian super villain and using force, manipulation, deception, and strategic ruthlessness to take it at the expense of others.
Individuals demonstrating value to other individuals — or companies demonstrating value to a society — gain power as a direct result.

backup what you're preaching
make yourself as part of a team
make people feel as part of a family

leader persuader -- mix com persuasion 

Always be clear and specific about what you expect from other people. You can not expect from them what you haven’t articulated…usually many times and in writing. Also plan for them to fail you.

a good leader:
a) knows when to speak and when don't.
b) knows to create a vision of where they wanna go.

When someone is out of line, don’t let it slide too far.
If you let someone treat your poorly for too long in order to avoid conflict, things will get so bad that you then have to have a huge fight in order to correct them. What could have been very small is now a real problem that may compromise your relationship, business, etc.

Beth Comstock:

2. Organize Around Information Flows: In the digital age, information moves fast. To keep up with information flows, you have to ditch hierarchy. There’s no room for bureaucracy. It’s about openness, candor, radical feedback and full transparency. If you organize your organization around these tenets, you’ll thrive.

3. Empower Individuals: Build a team of people who are prepared for change and empower them to do great work. The question is: how do you get people to get excited to grab power and go for it? More autonomy.

4. Define your company’s “MO” -- Mindset Orientation: Mindset is everything. As a leader, you must provide the vision and then allow your teams to figure their way out. Create a mindset that incentivizes them to do what they need to do the fastest, best way they can. It means they may fail. You should encourage them to fail fast, learn from their mistakes, and keep going. At GE, this process is called FastWorks, and it’s built on lean startup methodology.

5. Establish Feedback Loops: Exponential leaders must both give and receive feedback – and importantly, they have to actually use it. Beth offers three ideas here:

First: “One of the things we’ve done at GE is we’ve actually gotten rid of our employee performance reviews. Anyone in the organization can give anyone feedback. I just did a Facebook Live event last week and one of my young colleagues in the company gave me some feedback. It wasn’t so good… ‘You weren’t looking at the camera at the right point. You looked like you were distracted.’ It was hard feedback to receive, but it was encouraged.”

“What is the one thing that is true that you think I don’t want to hear?” Beth comments that you’ll be amazed what you’ll learn. It’s extremely valuable.

Third: Rather than doing long, convoluted employee surveys, stick to a simple feedback mechanism: Continue, or consider. You get feedback that says either “Continue doing X” or “Consider changing X to make it better.” It’s really simple, fast and actionable.

6. Get Used to Living in the In-Between: Exponential leaders are comfortable with ambiguity and uncertainty. This is going to be key to survive the change that is coming.

7. Mash Up Minds and Machines: Exponential leaders use technology to their advantage, combining the power of computing and data with human leadership.

8. Prioritize Innovation and Observe Patterns That Block It: Innovating is really hard. Good leaders understand they have to navigate the tension. Sometimes leaders give up, and they don’t hold their team accountable for growing. They themselves back off on it. And so is it any wonder that the people on the team deprioritize innovating?.

1. Always be an Ambassador for Your Team, Innovation Happens Everywhere.

3. Once a Decision is Made, It is Supported. Period. This is really important. Once a decision is made in a meeting, there must be no second-guessing of that decision after the fact. Sue explains, “When we walk out of that room, and you’ve had all the chance to actually defend your position to make the decision, it’s time to start executing. That’s it.” If you need to change a strategy, use data from implementation to support your argument and bring it up in the next decision-making meeting.

4. Proactive Problem Management – Go Directly to the Source: As complexity increases, so too does the potential for conflict or confusion. As an exponential leader, you must be proactive in managing this. Sue’s strategy is simple and clear: “Go to the source, directly to the source. Don’t complain to managers or others before you’ve gone to the person first to resolve the conflict.”

7. You Can’t Delegate Culture: This is absolutely critical for exponential leaders. Culture can make or break a company, and therefore it a) must be very high on a leader’s list of priorities and b) must come from the top. Leaders can’t delegate culture. Sue goes on, “Leaders are the culture bearers, the torchkeepers of culture in our companies. They might have change agents, or those that actually help them amplify their culture, but the leader cannot delegate culture. This is a truth that a lot of us forget because we’re so busy. Employees and teams really want to see it from their leaders. They want to hear the talk, they want to watch them walk the talk, all the time.” Interestingly, while leaders cannot delegate culture creation, they can delegate culture keeping.

leadership is based on emotional intelligence

There are three keys: honesty, effectiveness, and efficiency.

Situational leadership :) Adapt your leadership style to the skills and confidence of those you are leading.
In a situation where your subordinates are unsure of what to do and they really don't have the skills to do it alone, you have to provide leadership and encouragement. Lead by example, show them how to do it, and let them iterate without too much micromanagement.
When your subordinates are competent but lacking confidence, it's often a better option to stand back and say nothing. The "ownership" piece is huge -- if this is the first big project you've "owned", you'll probably iron out the kinks even if I don't say anything to you. Also keep in mind is that there are many correct ways to solve a problem; while your solution may not be the one I would go with, you're more comfortable with your solution and can probably see things about it that I can't. I trust you to be the expert on the solution; I've got bigger things to worry about like how I'm going to continue servicing my same workload with a 10% cut in budget.
The goal is to move everyone up from "unconfident and incompetent" to "confident and competent". Some people also go through "incompetent and confident", which is also something where the best option is often to stand back and act as a safety net while letting the person learn whatever lesson they needed to learn.

- Life in a zoo is easier, but it isn't the life they were designed for.
- A group of 10 people within a large organization is a kind of fake tribe. The number of people you interact with is about right. But something is missing: individual initiative. Tribes of hunter-gatherers have much more freedom. The leaders have a little more power than other members of the tribe, but they don't generally tell them what to do and when the way a boss can. In the first couple weeks of working on their own startup they seem to come to life, because finally they're working the way people are meant to.
- Another thing you notice when you see animals in the wild is that each species thrives in groups of a certain size. A herd of impalas might have 100 adults; baboons maybe 20; lions rarely 10. Humans also seem designed to work in groups, and what I've read about hunter-gatherers accords with research on organizations and my own experience to suggest roughly what the ideal size is: groups of 8 work well; by 20 they're getting hard to manage; and a group of 50 is really unwieldy

### On teams: management and delegation

Managing is delegating. Your speed as a manager is the speed of the team.

> *'Don’t postpone to tomorrow what other people can do for you today.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'Be productive, not cheap. Stop dicking around trying to figure stuff out that someone else already knows.'*

> *'If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.' -- African proverb*

> *'A manager should make himself 2 questions a day:   
«What is important to accomplish?» (where are you going)  
«Where was I uncomfortable the day before?» (what went right and where do you need support)  
The speed that you offload your stuff will be the speed of your team.'*

> *'Your productivity as a manager is measured as the productivity of your team. Being seated making stuff is not productive.
The key principle is putting your team’s productivity first. Remember, you are a communication hub and a multiplier. Think about the things you can delegate vs. the things that only you can do. If you truly work for your people instead of hiding at your desk, just tell yourself: what I accomplished today is not yet visible, but it will be.'*

> *'Productivity is different from workflow engineering.'*

For that you need to [communicate](#on-communication).

> *'Spend one hour a day just talking to your people and everything will be OK.'*

> *'The goal is to move everyone up from «unconfident and incompetent» to «confident and competent».' -- exelius*

> *'Start a meeting with an overachieving question: «how can we raise sales by 12%?»'*

Instead of generalizing and saying «management is useless», it's more correct to say «bad management is counterproductive».  
The only reason there’s so many awful managers is that people like you refuse to do the job.

How to give feedback?  
- Ask instead of telling.

> *'«Is that the best you can do?»  
«Interesting, how do you feel about it?»  
«What does your team think?»  
«Why did you decide to do X in that order?» This creates a dialog, instead of a debate where each side first stakes out positions. Lead your people to discover what you would have suggested. Smart people will get to the same place you were going, or if you are humble enough to listen, you may learn something.'*

- If you're certain the delivered work is not good enough give a reason.

> *'«Can you take another look at this for XYZ reasons?». This gives the employee ownership of the final deliverable, while still prompting them to deal with problems they overlooked. «Because» is a great motivator.'*

HOWEVER... gaining an understanding and giving appropriate feedback makes your juniors feel like what they are doing is important. Pounding directives down or not giving any direction are demotivators.

> *'Delegating isn’t as easy as it looks. It takes some real chutzpah to make someone do your work for insufficient compensation while you rake in the big bucks.'*

But data shows people want more feedback but monthly, not daily.

Some are clever and diligent -- their place is the General Staff. The next lot are stupid and lazy -- they make up 90 percent of every army and are suited to routine duties. Anyone who is both clever and lazy is qualified for the highest leadership duties, because he possesses the intellectual clarity and the composure necessary for difficult decisions. One must beware of anyone who is stupid and diligent -- he must not be entrusted with any responsibility because he will always cause only mischief.

### On hiring and being hired

Trial most but only hire likable persons that «get shit done».  
Your goal in business should be to «fire» yourself and hire people who are better at your job than you are.  
To build an empire you must become a master at finding and hiring talent.

> *'Two valid methods: hiring on culture contribution and hiring on culture matching.'*

> *'Bad professionals make money off their customers, good professionals make money for their customers.' -- Jacques Mattheij*

> *'He who works with his hands is a laborer.  
He who works with his hands and his head is a craftsman.  
He who works with his hands and his head and his heart is an artist.' -- St. Francis of Assisi*

> *'We value “T-shaped” people. That is, people who are both generalists (highly skilled at a broad set of valuable things—the top of the T) and also experts (among the best in their field within a narrow discipline—the vertical leg of the T) (...) An expert who is too narrow has difficulty collaborating. A generalist who doesn’t go deep enough in a single area ends up on the margins, not really contributing as an individual. Where you choose to be deep should be an area of interest to you and which the market values.' -- Valve employee book*

How to attract and keep talented people? Respect them.  
You'll never respect them if you don't reward them accordingly.

> *'Create contracts that build up «golden handcuffs» offering your new hires the ability to earn as much as they want, provided that they are earning you even more income in the process.'*

HOWEVER good employeees are not easy to find.

> *'Always look for internal spies, people in the enemy camp who are dissatisfied and have an ax to grind.'*

> *'They don’t want to lose you. They don’t want to lose the negotiation. And they don’t want to restart the hiring process. Hiring is a long and expensive process.'*

HINTS on CVs:

When applying for a job be more of a consultant than an applicant.

A resume or list of previous jobs is a nice timeline. But as a maker, your creation is the ultimate validation.

I’m a recruiter. The best advice that I can give.
Your resume should tell the reader what is going to make you more valuable to the company than the next person. You’ll show that with your experience.
DON’T tell me about your responsibilities. Everyone who is doing your type of job has those responsibilities. Tell me HOW you accomplished your responsibilities better than the next person.
ie. Your a car salesperson. You are responsible for selling cars (so is every other car salesperson). You sold more cars than anyone else in the dealership for six months out of the last year. Which person would you hire.

Most reviewers are only going to understand two skill levels:
still learning the skill / confident in the skill

<!--
If your manager or employer says “No” the first time around (and this is very likely), don’t get discouraged. Simply thank them for their time and ask them “What specific outcomes would be required for me to receive this raise within the next 3-6 months?” If they can’t answer this question, you should probably find another employer.

people leave managers, not companies

people want freedom to choose their process

The most important lessons I learned were to remember that I'd hired them to do things that I could not. As such, they knew their job better than I did. If I could have done it myself, I'd not have had to hire them.
Hire people you can trust. You have to trust them to be adults. Give them clear goals and then get the hell out of the way so that they can do their job.
Give them the tools they ask for, not the tools a vendor suggested. They have a reason they asked for a proprietary compiler, get it for them.
Respect goes a long way and begins in the recruitment phase. It surely doesn't end there. To get respect, you have to give respect.
Train, train, train. If you treat your employee right, you can absolutely train them and not worry about them being poached. Salary is actually a small part of overhead. Pay them well and treat them well. Our print room cost more than a senior employee. There's no reason to pay crap wages.
At the same time, wages aren't everything. Everyone wants to make good money but when you're already assured of making good money, other things start to count. Help your employees in their goals. If you have a QA that wants to move to dev, don't offer to pay back their educational expenses, but pay their expenses outright, pay for their child care, pay for their books, and keep paying their salary while they work a reduced schedule. Really, if you're treating them right, they won't just up and go to a new company after you've trained them.
I can go on, but there's a few things I've learned.

Have you seen that one position that you absolutely want? Build your portfolio around that job’s requirements and responsibilities. -> targeted cv

Tip #3: A lot of portfolios are used both for job applications and freelance clients. Don’t do this. The best practice is for a professional to design separate portfolios for each of those audiences.

Every little detail matters.
Here is the toughest point for a lot of people: you can’t control what your reviewer sees on your portfolio.

"Estimativas são Promessas. Promessas devem ser cumpridas.".
In a nutshell, you can never give an estimate that is "correct". If you could, it would not be an "estimate", it would be a "prediction".

Therefore, there is zero correlation between an estimate and the actual outcome.

If you're a knowledge worker decisions are your product. Milton Friedman, the economist, wrote: “The best measure of quality thinking is your ability to accurately predict the consequences of your ideas and subsequent actions.”

There's nothing wrong in specialization -- it's how we stay sane. A very workable and easy to understand formula early in your career is specialize in two things; you don't have to be better at X and better at Y than everyone you meet, you have to be "better at X than anyone who is better at Y" and "better at Y than anyone who is better at X." This is very, very achievable, regardless of how highly competent your local set of peers is.

> *'Go where you can make a difference not where you think there’s a home run.'

autentic pride (genuine) vs hubristic pride (egotistic)
-
Startups are (by necessity) filled with generalists; big companies are filled with specialists. People underestimate how effective a generalist can be at things which are done by specialists. People underestimate how deep specialties can run. These are simultaneously true.

companies hire for a problem and not general optimizations. Even if they need a generalist.

Try consulting or entrepreneurship.
When you sell your time, you need to fit into a role that someone can comprehend and already knows they need.
When you sell your ability to deliver results, nobody asks about your skillset.

### On career

Avoid the trap of following one set career path. Focus on being useful, it will be easier to pivot when needed.  
Being an employee is long-term risky.

> *'The interesting jobs are the ones that you make up.' -- Chris Young*

> *'Is it better to be good at many things or great at one thing?  
To be an entrepreneur you need to know a little about a lot of things.  
To be employed, you'll do better as a specialist. If you pick the right specialization.'*

> *'You dont get anywhere, and for more money, sitting in the same seat.'*

> *'My luggage is always ready.' -- Portuguese soccer coach*

The risk is the salaried employee in an economy with shrinking corporations, more outsourcing, more automation, who get their stable paycheck and every month risk being fired. The economy forces all the risk on it’s poorest members – employees who have no control over their futures. Entrepreneurs get rid of risk so they can have more control over their future.

differentiate yourself / volunteer for assignments
becoming the go to guy for some questions

I always advise young people to become good public speakers (top 25%). Anyone can do it with practice. If you add that talent to any other, suddenly you’re the boss of the people who have only one skill. Or get a degree in business on top of your engineering degree, law degree, medical degree, science degree, or whatever. Suddenly you’re in charge, or maybe you’re starting your own company using your combined knowledge.

How to «pivot» career?

Cultivate a relevant skill stack. Capitalism rewards things that are both rare and valuable. You make yourself rare by combining two or more “pretty goods” until no one else has your mix.

- be aware of it, cultivate it consciously, and apply it in pursuit of a personal goal.  
- use the career fuel (transportable skills) that you have: soft skills (e.g. persuasive communication: pitching and change somebody's opinion, emotional intelligence, ability to read the room, ability to build trust, ability to retain talent) and hard skills.
write a pitch, are u persuasive, can you change somebody else opinion. making a 2 minute youtube, etc.  
- find the people that were working for them. top leaders ask for help and give knowledge away. more open source.  
- take risks to boost your immune system.*

pivoting?
- Pivoting isn’t easy, even if you know it’s right.  
- Pivoting is a mindset.  
- You will either pivot or get pivoted. -> everything is changing all the time  
- Changes are usually for the best.  
- You don’t have to be a “brand” to be discoverable. -- just add value!

> *'People pivot combining two skills.. E.g. Data Scientist is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician.'*

How to advance career? knowledge + metaknowledge (don't ask, journal higher hierarchy than you)

- Become the best at one specific thing.  
- Become very good (top 25%) at two or more things.

> *'Your work is the greatest mean at your disposal for expressing your social intelligence.'*

On college:

> *'«I want to have a safety net so I can get a job.» This is what my daughter said to me. Where did she learn the phrase “Safety net”?
Maybe the thing about college is that a child is not yet ready to be an adult.
It’s the last time they will ever hang out with people their own age. My closest friends are not my age. In college though, they were.
It’s scary to be an adult. To survive. It’s a jungle. College is still a walled safe city for kids just like you.
I would pay a lot to be a child again. To not make the mistakes of adulthood. To not have those fears.
So maybe that’s what the college tuition is. The cost to extend childhood. And the cost of childhood is going up.' -- James Altucher*

> *'The purpose of high education is first and foremost to meet people and build relationships.'*

How to get employers feedback?  
If you ask them why did they asked you for an interview, they will describe your strengths.

<!--
- trabalhar de porta aberta vs trabalhar à porta fechada
- jobs that are specialized are boring.
- Oh, this is an easy one. When people say a child is talented they mean he or she is a good learner. But a talented adult is a good do-er. High potential people who fail to make an impact are stuck in child-mode, because that is what they were always praised for.
- Jobs are like clothes. There is no "wrong job". There are jobs which fit now, and all other jobs.	
- From the point of view of a noob. I might be completely wrong: Tech marketability is important WHEN you are below average (my case). Otherwise any technology will grant you a job: if you know how to program, all languages are easy to pick. In my case, I'm still between React and Vue. While I prefer Vue, all jobs ask for React.	
- work smart not harder but hard still.

3. Always Focus on Delivering More Value than Expected

For every million people that want to be a successful musician, only one is going to achieve it.
If you’re going to be that one, you can’t do what everyone else is doing.
Whatever you do, it’ll be creative, efficient, and effective. That’s my definition of resourceful.
It means making something happen, instead of saying you can’t.
It means accessing all the people and skills you know, including the ones that take extra effort.
It usually means doing things for free, but can also mean spending a little money to save a lot of time.
It means using a shortcut around obstacles, getting in through a back door, bending the rules, and never waiting for permission.
It means asking for help, but not waiting for help.
So why do I hate to admit this?
Because I love how the internet has made it possible for anyone to get successful anywhere. I love the idea of living in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by nature, yet being connected to the world. But still, when I look at the facts, it’s impossible to deny. Actually living in the big city, and being in the middle of where everything is happening, will help your career the most. Being elsewhere won’t hurt you, but it won’t help. -- sivers

finding and winning a great job is a competitive subject. it's not very correlated with luck.

You are a learning machine… Not an occupation.
Ideas are Welcomed, Execution is Worshiped
Your Success is Someone Else’s Miracle

My passionate interests have changed 30 times since I graduated college.

recruiting better than hiring: find a place whre you can do a good job

Working hard for something we don’t care about is called stress; working hard for something we love is called passion.

You don’t give a damn about that job. It’s someone else’s dream

you need to get people attention

I seem to get satisfaction only from making stuff. Or maybe a better description would be solving problems and making improvements.

ex: selling generic copyright instead of mass persuasion
find your secret sauce and NAME it. whats unique.

> *'The difference between your best and your worst? The perception of others. Block out the noise and you’ll stay on track.' -- Phil Hellmuth*

its good to be better, but is better to be different.

> *'Be a jack-of-all-trades and a master of one.'*

specialization is dangereous

trade-able skills: figure out what skills you already have that you can charge for

read the classics: deliberately being 3 years behind on the latest technologies is a really good way to stay employable without driving yourself mad keeping up with the latest and greatest. After 3 years, the flash-in-the-pans and the duds have been winnowed out and you can just concentrate on the stuff which will earn you paying gigs.
	
ask what's your secret mission -- something you want to do here that another person is interested also\

100% time -> 100% results  
20% time -> 80%results  
So: 100% on one thing = 80% on 5 things!  

> *'How to return to an workplace:  
- reframe your experience. Use today and future jargons. Make your homework.  
- refresh your skill set, if you got rusty.  
- career ecosystems, get back into them, reconnect.  
- reboot self confidence. Surround yourself with confident people.'

Happy, Smart, and Useful

look at situations as systems. i help to create systems.

### On hierarchy

Everything is hierarchy.  
Only comedians can speak the truth without consequences.

> *'Never outshine the master.'  
'Know who you’re dealing with: do not offend the wrong person.'  
'Avoid stepping into a great man’s shoes.' -- Robert Greene (1st, 9th and 41st law of power)*

> *'Weak managers believe if an employee becomes irreplaceable, they have become expendable. Keeping employees dispensable is more important than keeping skilled talent. Their actions aren't random or stupid.'*

> *'Higher the status, more exposure to parasites whose transmission isn't environmentally mediated.'*

> *'The highest form of the art of power is the ability to distinguish the wolves from the lambs, the foxes from hares, the hawks from vultures.'*

> *'Social cartography: who's the decision maker, to whom people are speaking and who is speaking.'*

HOWEVER... don't vow to the gatekeepers. Most people are basically afraid of their superiors. Someone’s position does not make them important. You can replace them as quickly as they can replace you. It's a business relationship.

> *'Only the truth is funny.' -- Rick Reynolds*

on gatekeepers

> *'No hay prepotencia más ridícula que la que se destila de la creencia de que recopilar talento ajeno es un talento.' -- Jorge Luis Borges*
Es triste que gente con talento y sin dinero tenga que depender de gente con dinero y sin talento.

right amount of hierarchy and structure

> *'No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.' -- Eleanor Roosevelt*

To find the truths inside of us that make us all relate to each other. That bring us back to our common humanity.
This is why the comedians are the modern day philosophers.
