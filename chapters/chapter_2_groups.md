# 2.1 - On interaction

## On networking

> *'To develop your intellectual powers at the expense of the social is to retard your own progress to mastery.' -- Robert Greene*

Make networking an [habit](chapter_1_self.md#on-habits-and-systems): who you know and whether they like you will determine what opportunities you get. Ultimately, your network determines your net worth.

> *'The enemy of excellence is isolation.' -- Aaron Walker*

> *'It is astonishing what foolish things a man thinking alone can come temporarily to believe.' -- Keynes*

> *'Your silence will not protect you.' -- Audre Lorde*

> *'Do not build fortresses to protect yourself: isolation is dangerous.'  
'Play the perfect courtier.' -- Robert Greene (4th and 24th law of power)*

> *'You'll start to live when you can live outside yourself. Being in the moment instead of being in your head.'*  
> *'Social inadequacy AKA creepiness is based on unpredictability. Staring isn’t staring if you’re smiling or if you say hi.'*

### How to network?

Be useful, not important.

[Listen](chapter_2_groups.md#on-communication) to people, [infer](chapter_3_action.md#on-analysis) their goals and help them. It’s not about you, it’s about the impact you have on others and the legacy that you leave.

> *'You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you.' -- Dale Carnegie*

> *'If you expect magic in every encounter, you'll find it.' -- Adam Robinson*

### How to prepare an elevator pitch?

Choose truth or your self-mythology will seduce you.

> *'Being honest may not get you a lot of friends but it’ll always get you the right ones.' -- John Lennon*

> *'When it comes to the story of our own lives, we’re more like novelists, not journalists. We’re not reading from our confessional journals, but recounting a polished story we’ve rehearsed over years. So a bio becomes a highlight reel of pedigree and accomplishments. Most of the stories we hear about people’s success are nothing more than clever myth-making: a way of reconfiguring their past as they wish to remember it, shaping it into a compelling and effective narrative, and weaponizing it into a personal propaganda tool. That story might be «rags to riches», «rising from the ashes», «one yes after a thousand nos», «crazy till I wasn’t», or any one of the familiar narratives we’ve heard from our heroes.' -- Jordan Harbinger*

intro: //clay hebert
I help (or a derivative) investors (target: people is too generalist but don't over tailor it) to build better things (skill. use intrigue and confidence)
6 or 7 words -- short and sweet and confident and interesting.
ask them first so you can costumise it for the context and make it more relevant.

How to curate your network?

- Form relationships with those who seem like they’ll give at least as much than they take.  
- Expand from too long networks.
- Building new connections is important but it’s even more important to remember your connections that already exist. The difference between success and failure can be as simple as keeping in touch.  
- Community of experts (that give you good answers).  
- Critical peers (10 people that make a big difference in your immediate career).
- Networking types: advocates a, boomerang b, celebrities c, drainers d  
- Networking types: shark, dolphin, drowner.  
- Not what should I do next but who should you speak next?
- the best way to get value was to start giving it away? you're giving validation
-->

### Why most people don't like networking?

Handling rejection is hard.

> *'We don’t like people that see us in a way that doesn’t resonate with how we see ourselves.'*

> *'If people forget it wasn't a good network anyway.'*

> *'I don't know if you've ever noticed this, but first impressions are often entirely wrong.' -- Lemony Snicket*

## On communication

> *'People don’t listen, they just wait for their turn to talk.' -- Chuck Palahniuk*

Speak less and listen more. Be humble, listening is powerful.

> *'Knowledge speaks, but wisdom listens.' -- Jimi Hendrix*

> *'When you listen, you may learn something new.' -- Dalai Lama*

### How to communicate? 

- Smile and relax. Warmth comes from smiling while you speak. Popular people smile more than other people. Calm is largely a matter of slowing your speech down. Learn how to lessen the crushing pressure of being interesting by focusing on being interested: controlling the impression that you make on others takes a large amount of cognitive bandwidth and everything will appear as fake.

- Listen. Don't worry about what you’re going to say next. The best conversationalists are the best listeners. Ask a question. Listen to the answer. Respond in the form of a statement. Be interested to be interesting, Want to be the most interesting person in the room? learn the art of active listening. How do I get them talking about themselves? It gives their brain as much pleasure as food or money. And when they open up, don’t judge..  
	- Mirroring: Repeat the last 1-3 words the person just said as a question. (Yes, it’s that simple.)
	- Paraphrasing: Repeat what they just said in your own words.
	- Emphasize Similarity, we like people who are like us.

- Get better at asking questions, they are more important than answers. But asking questions without paying attention is worthless. You must be curious. Can be as simple as «what is your favourite book» or as deep as «why is your best friend, your best friend?». It's hard to fake an answer. “What kind of challenges did you have at work this week? What kind of challenges do you have living in this part of the country? What kinds of challenges do you have raising teenagers?” Everyone has got challenges. It gets people to share what their priorities in life are at that point in time. Making good/unusual questions will make peple interested in you. Be interested in them to them be interested in you.

- Talk about your passions instead of accomplishments. Look for external catalysts as hints for stories and questions. Pick up on often-ignored (but crucially important) nonverbal cues. Best subjects to discuss: ask stuff outside of their expertise where you can add value, travel, sincere compliments and asking for advice.

- Banish meaningless small talk and learn how to ask questions that build rapport and natural conversation. Treat new aquaintances as old friends. Build rapport, cut the BS. Speak what's in your mind, sometimes it backfires, but be real. The best way to be highly influential is to be human to everyone you meet.

- Know how to lead a conversation and how to go with the conversational flow. No one is inherently boring. They’re only boring because you haven’t asked the right questions.

- Don't be stubborn: you don't always have to get the last word. Make your point and leave it. Let go. Is more productive to say «yes and» instead of «yes but». Get rid of ego and add value. Don't judge.

<!--
- be autentic offer good energy, be human, build rapport, listen, humbleness, genuine appreciation. How to make a good first impression: putting your best foot forward actually reveals the real you. smile, When individuals speak slowly and clearly, they tend to sound more credible than those who speak quickly. Stop Trying To Impress research from Harvard shows people would rather work with a lovable fool than a competent jerk -- even if they won’t admit it.

Keep a journal and write about what you’re looking forward to and excited about in life. That’ll keep ideas on the tip of your tongue, ready to discuss. It’s okay to write the same thing over and over each day. The point is to move what’s exciting you to the top of your mental list so you’re ready to go if an opportunity presents.
-->

### How to tell good stories?

Good stories condense a massive amount of information into a consumable and shareable form. Its primary purpose isn’t accuracy, but entertainment; and when it is accurate, it’s only accurate to the extent that the story requires in order to remain relevant.

> *'Cinema is just life with the boring parts cut out.' -- Alfred Hitchcock*

> *'The more you say, the less people remember.' -- François Fénelon*

### How to discord?

Listen as you're wrong. «Will you tell me your story? I’d love to know how you came to this point of view. It sounds like I could learn something.»  

> *'Never argue with a fool, onlookers may not be able to tell the difference.' -- Mark Twain*

<!--
Hints on public speaking:

When public speaking you dont need to answer their question. you can say whatever you want if its interesting. Know when to answer boring on easy to misinterpret questions. Agree as much as you can without lieing. Ask questions instead of saying desagreements.

1 - «Rescue people instead of «cold calling». Include people to gain allies. Become the conduit in your circle — the one who makes sure introductions are made. It really is as simple as asking, “Have you met my friend, Johnny?” Take that responsibility and welcome strangers into your group, and you’ll help everyone feel like they’re part of the conversation. That’s all anyone wants when they’re out – to feel included.
2 - Small and open groups. Opening line: "Hi, I'm X and I dont know anybody in this party."
3 - Go to the bar and meet people there.
4 - Help the hosters to serve food.
5 - Escaping lines: how to politely end conversations. You should go on after 10 or 15 minutes. Think about it as exploring.
	"excuse me but i must to talk with somebody that entered the room"
	"excuse me i have to make a phone call"
	human sacrifice.. intro him and leave.
	To rude people: «my mum always told me not to speak with strangers, now I know why»

17. Think before you speak. There is always time to add a word, never to withdraw one. Talk as if you were making your will: the fewer words the less litigation. In trivial matters exercise yourself for the more weighty matters of speech. Profound secrecy has some of the lustre of the divine. -- Balthasar Gracian

## On business and entrepreneurship

> *'I think the role of the entrepreneur in the world is to find ways to do things better or more efficiently and then try to do that as many times over with the help of other people.' -- Santiago Nestares*

> *'What you need to start a new business: generosity.' -- Derek Sivers*

Focus on what can you give instead of focusing in making money. Once you find your market you'll get the reward.  

It's not about what you know, it's about who trusts you to solve their problems. Often, that requires the technical skills. Always, that requires the communication skills to persuade someone you can do it.

Test sales first. Validate your business by finding paying clients. If something is worth doing, sales will come easy and dollars will be high. If you have to drag people along kicking and screaming, you’re wasting your time. If they were in, they'd be in on day one. The more they pay, the more they value it: the consumer votes with his wallet.

> *'Without customers, you don’t have a business. You have a hobby.' -- Don Peppers & Martha Rogers*

Hints:

- Focus on revenue generating activities: if it is not going to earn you money, then don’t do it.  
- Do things that don’t scale  
- Pre-product market fit – do things that don’t scale: remain small/nimble  
- Do things manually at first. You don’t have to build an elaborate system to get started. Get one client and do everything the hard way. Only after business is over running your ability to do things manually you do have to worry about automation. Don’t put a bunch of effort in on the front end to find out there’s no demand.  
- Don’t scale your team/product until you have built something people want  
- You only have to be really right once: Zuckerberg thought that Facebook was going to be a college directory and that was it. Bill Gates didn’t think the Internet had any potential. They were right about one thing one time and made so much money that it allows them to be consistently wrong over and over again in big ways because their underlying model was right the first time. They had the resources to correct any mistakes and to try a lot of other things, most of which will fail.  
- It’s easier when YOU are the customer. You truly understand the problem. Start with something I'm interested in. Don't worry about the theory; just focus on solving the problem. Solve the problem; start broadening my focus from there. <- on learning programming 
- Scratch your own itch it's good only as a start. Build something people want: Find 10-100 customers who love your product   
- Sometimes you need to fire your customers (they might be killing you)  
- In some complex and mature markets if you start too small you will never be able to compete with existent players. «Starting up in a garage» works mostly on new and undeveloped markets.
- If you have an idea, test it. It’s called putting out a “minimally viable product” or MVP. 
- Create a culture that rewards killing ideas. Kill a lot of ideas. There is no risk to our people; nobody gets fired. In fact, people get praised when we kill something, we saved a lot of money.  
- Equity unlocks human potential: when people feel like they have ownership in an idea, they can’t stop thinking about it. The more ideas your stakeholders contribute, the better off your chances are at succeeding.  
- “It’s not your money”  
- Timing is the most important factor in startup success. Team and Execution came next.
- Launch now. Find the 90/10 solution  
- CEOs are [adaptable and flexible](chapter_3_action.md#on-adapting) and good risk managers.
- Founder relationships matter more than you think. Be nice! Or at least don’t be a jerk
- All startups are badly broken at some point  
- Startups can only solve one problem well at any given time  
- Growth is the result of a great product not the precursor  
- Ignore your competitors, you will more likely die of suicide than murder  
- Valuation is not equal to success or even probability of success  
- Most companies don’t die because they run out of money  
- Write code – talk to users  
- Avoid long negotiated deals with big customers if you can. Fire customers that cause you to much stress or that cost too much to service.  
- Avoid big company corporate development queries – they will only waste time  
- Avoid conferences unless they are the best way to get customers  
- Be cautious. Entrepreneurs normally take a big risk and offset it with cautious moves (e.g. day job). Entrepreneurs are more risk averse than general population. Entrepreneurs prepare for bad. They budget pessimistically using the worst case scenario.
- Fall in love with the problem, not the solution.
- There’s the myth that failure makes you a better entrepreneur. This is FALSE. Study your failures.
- If there are tasks that need to be done that do not directly result in the generation of revenue, then outsource them so that you have more time to work on building your cash flow.

Patterns on successful *wannapreneurs*.

- They talk to people about their ideas, but never build anything.  
- They build something without first talking to people.  
- They build something and never try to sell it.  
- If you build something that people say they'll pay for and then they don't actually pay for it then this is problematic, but also normal and doesn't make you a wannapreneur. At that point it's just part of the struggle.

> *'Sara Blakely used the word «empower» several times. Spanx clothes gives women more confidence. Empowers women. The Belly Art Project empowers pregnant women'*
 
> *'When evaluating an idea make sure the math scales. E.g. If you’re looking for a restaurant location, look at how many seats, average price of meal, average turnover time, multiply it out. Will even max capacity pay the rent? How many potential sales, how much does it cost to reach them, what is a conversion rate to expect? How much can you produce in an hour, will that ever pay you enough?'*

<!--
Judgement requires experience, but can be built faster by learning foundational skills.
There is no skill called “business.” Avoid business magazines and business classes.
Study microeconomics, game theory, psychology, persuasion, ethics, mathematics, and computers.
Reading is faster than listening. Doing is faster than watching.
You should be too busy to “do coffee" while still keeping an uncluttered calendar.
Set and enforce an aspirational personal hourly rate. If fixing a problem will save less than your hourly rate, ignore it. If outsourcing a task will cost less than your hourly rate, outsource it.
Work as hard as you can. Even though who you work with and what you work on are more important than how hard you work.
Become the best in the world at what you do. Keep redefining what you do until this is true.
There are no get rich quick schemes. That's just someone else getting rich off you.
Apply specific knowledge, with leverage, and eventually you will get what you deserve.
When you're finally wealthy, you'll realize that it wasn't what you were seeking in the first place. But that's for another day.
- - persuade people to buy rather than teach people to buy.	
- a niche is about what people need. It’s not about you at all. And you can fill a niche competently. But you can also fill it incompetently (at least iitially, until others come along and start competing).
- startup isn’t really a company at all. A startup is a set of founders with hopefully a set of proprietary insights that are a result of them living in the future. most of the great startups come from a great insight and a great insight usually occurs when someone is living in the future and they notice something that’s missing.
- cant be an entrepeneur without being curious

- pro tip: Ask your current customers “What nearly stopped you buying from us?”
- There is a golden rule, long cherished by restaurateurs, for determining whether a business is viable. Rent should take up no more than 25 percent of your revenue, another 25 percent should go toward payroll, and 35 percent should go toward the product. The remaining 15 percent is what you take home. There's an even more elegant version of that rule: Make your rent in four days to be profitable, a week to break even. If you haven't hit the latter mark in a month, close.
- I'm not surprised that high-end retail is still doing fine. People want the luxury purchasing experience to be luxurious -- they'd rather buy their luxury goods in boutiques than get them delivered in a cardboard box from Amazon.
- if you’re an entrepreneur who opens a coffee shop, you’ll have a lot of ways you can make money. You can sell coffee, cakes, paintings, merchandise, and more. But each of those things will not contribute to your success in an equal way. While there is value in the discovery process, once you’ve found the variable that matters most, you should place more time on that one and less on the others.

Friend of a friend owns a small chain of grocery stores in New Jersey. A few years ago, when Amazon got into groceries, he changed his mind about investing in the growth of his own business. He started buying Amazon shares with his investment capital instead. He saw what happened to Circuit City and Tower Records, Borders and Barnes & Noble. So he bought some Amazon and then he bought some more.
This wasn’t retirement investing. This was something else. What should we call it? Disruption Insurance?
- Jeff Bezos summed this up when he said “Your margin is my opportunity.” The key to business and investing success isn’t finding an advantage. It’s having a sustainable advantage. Something that others either can’t or aren’t willing to copy once your idea is exposed and patents expire.

- É por isso que não tenho patrão, para não me cortarem a criatividade. -- Cesar Borja

- One of my favorite pg ideas: "When something is described as a toy, that means it has everything an idea needs except being important. It's cool; users love it; it just doesn't matter. But if you're living in the future and you build something cool that users love, it may matter more than outsiders think."
	
Moonshot: 10X bigger instead of 10%. imply a new process not an optimization.
Aiming for something that is 10x better vs 10% better is 100 times more worth it… but never 100 times harder.

Raising money: The problem is that investors are too easy when it comes to giving second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth chances... And they absolutely suck at giving first chances to the right people. Investors just sit there and assume that the right people will find them, but they don't. The right people are too busy working to be chasing down investors 24/7. The first-timers who end up getting funded over and over again are usually the ones who network 24/7 and their only real talent is seducing investors who confuse their well-rehearsed talk for passion and intelligence.

- startups are similar to biological life. Wherever the conditions are hospitable, life already exists.
The difference is that startups live in an economic rather than a biological environment. -> funds dont mind that u fail if they have also some winners
- there's not a lot competition neither a lot of people looking for change. our biggest competitor is indifference and inaction. people are already solving their problems, better or worse. very few people are always researching for something better.
- The biggest assumption I ever made in business is that most people are telling me the truth. Most people have no idea what truth is.

1) Do networking and listen. It's not about how great you are in your wildest dreams.
2) Deliver a little bit more than expected. That'll help to get you some recommendations.
3) Don't follow every new tech stack, framework whatsoever hype. Choose your toolchain where you are feeling comfortable with.
4) Raise your hourly rate. There's nothing wrong with it, if you're doing a great job based on past projects.
5) Say "No" to nasty, time consuming and time wasting clients.
6) Build your own brand to be proud of.

- give where you are naturally good

2. Make long-term bets.

I recall reading that someone had more success with a "unlock feature X" model of payment, even though it in total was more expensive than unlocking everything at once. people underestimate the power of free. trusted to one day pay me. send an email to all readers saying that i'm making consultations.

## On selling, negotiation and price

We're all in sales. 

To sell is to deal with objections. Sales used to be about information asymmetry but now it's mostly [applied persuasion](chapter_3_action.md#on-charming) and keeping [relationships](). Best sellers are now ambiverts.

> *'Traditional selling: extroverts -> cold calling -> tech made it more difficult  
Intruding (to get your foot in the door)  
Pitching (to persuade the customer to buy)  
Persisting (to push until you make the sale)'*

> *'Effective selling: ambiverts and introverts -> we don't need hunters, just farmers  
Research (to understand the customer - time spent alone on the Web, reading and analyzing information)  
Listening (to understand individual needs - being patient and quiet while remaining open to new ideas and perspectives)  
Reacting (to adapt to the identified needs - letting the other person set the pace and the agenda)'*

> *'Instead of details use interesting testimonials that allow people to relate.'*

> *'Go into job interviews with a story in mind. All an interviewer really wants to know is if he can spend eight hours a day around you.'*

Negotiation establishes the price (exchange rate between money and value).
That said, a bad/good negotiation means that you are adding more/less value than receiving for it.

> *'You don’t get what you deserve in life, you only get what you negotiate.'*

> *'Pay too much for everything. The effort spent getting a deal is only a distraction and attention is your most limited resource.' -- Allen Tucker*

### How to negotiate? 

The more you take, the more you can give back in meaningless concessions. To negotiate is to have options.

- «What’s your best out-the-door price? (...) Can you do X% below that? If you can reach my price, I’ll buy today.»
- Never negotiate with binary questions: '«What can you do?» instead of «Will you do this?»'  
- Saying no: «How am I supposed to do that?». «How» gives people an opportunity to show how smart they are.'
- If you want to go fast, let the other part go first.

> *'Control the options: get others to play with the cards you deal.' -- Robert Greene (31st law of power)*

> *'When people feel they have a choice, they walk into your trap that much more easily.'*

> *'When asking for help, appeal to people’s self-interest, never to their mercy or gratitude.' -- Robert Greene (13th law of power)*

- Tone of voice is a big clue to know with whom we are negotiating:

> *'The analytical cold guy is very patient;  
The assertive guy (eg. Trump) wants to make it fast;  
For the accomodator, the relationship is the most important'*

> *'People may or may not say what they mean,” he explained, “but they always say something designed to get what they want.' -- David Mamet*

> *'On negotiation you don't need to match the other person mood, you should be playful and smart, taking the other to mirror your good mood also.'*

> *'Mirroring and reword. repeating the last one to three words of the other person. It opens up people's brain. Its' very effective. Test the firmness of what they want. People didn't even realize it.'*

However always strive to achieve a win-win situation. The deal will fall if both sides don't take what they need from it. The most dangerous negotiation is the one you don’t know you’re in.

> *'You can’t make a good deal with a bad person.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'Peace cannot be kept by force. It can only be achieved by understanding.' -- Albert Einstein*

- Responding to Job Offers for Maximum Impact
Letter One [Strong Response]
Bob, [First name: power play.]

I appreciate the consideration and the offer. I truly enjoyed our conversation and feel great about the team and company. [Reiterate passion; set the tone.]

I need to evaluate this based on other opportunities I am looking at and will get back to you shortly. [Display social proof/market validation.] As I am doing that it would be helpful to know if there is any flexibility in the terms? [Put them on the defensive.]

I look forward to your response. [Power close.]

Cheers,

Letter Two [Counteroffer]
Bob, [First name: power play.]

I appreciate the consideration and the offer. [A meaningless courtesy that doesn’t do much, but when it isn’t there, people notice.] I am very excited about the team, the product and the direction of the company. I know I can make a big impact on the organization. [Reiterate passion and set the tone for the back-and-forth. Also a power play.]

Based on other opportunities I am looking at, I feel xxx,xxx,xxx.xx is a fair number for what I can bring to ______. [12%-15% above the offer is optimal. Higher, and you risk insulting them or pricing yourself out of the job. Lower and you could be leaving money on the table.] If you can match that I am ready to sign today and will give my notice tomorrow. [This is the most important part. Present a slam dunk and dare them not to take it. You are coming over the top with enthusiasm; it’s a power play and almost always pays off.]

I look forward to your response. [Power play; leave them with good vibes.]

Cheers,

Always use first names (caveat: unless their title vastly exceeds yours — if they’re on LinkedIn, use how they address themselves there as a reference.)
Never make the first offer.
Thank them.
Set the tone for the negotiation.
Display social proof/market validation.
Set your “ask.”
Help them visualize the win.
Reiterate interest and close strong.

- First establish a baseline — use Google.
Ask if they will match advertised prices from a competitor.
“What is your best out the door price?”
“Will you do that -10%?”
“If you reach my price, I will buy today.”
“I am on the phone with xxxx; they have this advertised for $xxxx. Can you beat that?”
“If I buy here, will you throw in xxxx?”
“What if I pay cash?”
“Okay, thank you. It’s helpful to know where you stand. I am going to check out a couple of your competitors and will be back if it makes sense.”
WALK AWAY.

- Unexpressed feelings never die. Releasing pressure is different from venting.
- The more influence somebody is the more they use we / plural pronouns.

- Negotiate contracts in minute detail on the front end so that you aren’t negotiating after work is done, investments are made, and you have no bargaining power. This is especially important if the relationship between people is important as it avoids conflict later on.

- make an agreement on a standard of value. my standard of value for a weekend: some combination of rejuvenation and human connection.
normally we fall into habits. we don't do what is best for ourselves.

- One time a college far away in Ohio, about a 12-hour drive, asked what I would charge to do a two-hour show.
I said, “$1500”. She said, “Oh, that’s a bit too much. What would you charge to do just a one-hour show?”
I said, “$2000”. She said, “No, wait, you’ll be performing less, not more!”
I said, “Yeah! Exactly! What you’re paying me for is to get there! Once I’m there, playing music is the fun part! If you tell me I have to get back in the van after only an hour, and drive home, then I’m going to charge you more than if you let me play for a couple hours first.”
She liked that so much she came up with the $1500. -- Derek Sivers

- Alex says you can even create a worksheet for yourself by asking clear and direct questions like:
What am I negotiating? What is my timeline? (This will affect your urgency.) Who are the parties involved? (Asking questions will ensure you are dealing with the decision-maker.) What are my interests in this particular case? when asked for a number: “I’m looking at a few different offers and opportunities — what were you thinking?” When you do get an offer, Alex recommends not counteroffering immediately. “Say thank you for the offer and that you are grateful for the opportunity, and then ask if there is any flexibility on the base. A great closing line: “Based on other opportunities, if you can match this (salary) I can give notice tomorrow.” Alex points out that he wouldn’t hire someone who would simply accept the first offer he gives.

- Call all owners to rent. 8 said yes. Then auction! 2200 -> 1500.

> *'Marketers don’t convince. Engineers convince. Marketers persuade. Persuasion appeals to the emotions and to fear and to the imagination. Convincing requires a spreadsheet or some other rational device.' -- Seth Godin*
> *'You don’t convince people by challenging their longest and most firmly held opinions. You find common ground and work from there. Or you look for leverage to make them listen. Or you create an alternative with so much support from other people that the opposition voluntarily abandons its views and joins your camp.' -- Ryan Holiday, The Obstacle Is the Way*
- It’s much easier to persuade someone if they’re already convinced, if they already know the facts. But it’s impossible to change someone’s mind merely by convincing them of your point.

## On relationships

> *'Humans make connections.  
Sometimes these connections grow.  
Sometimes they stay the same.  
Sometimes they collapse.'*

A great relationship is about finding the similarities and respect the differences.  
Trust and vulnerability are correlated. Trust someone if they say they are human and susceptible to conflicts of interest but actively avoiding them.
 
> *'You loose your identity, you loose people.' -- Amy Cuddy*

> *'If you are struggling in your relationships, odds are, you are withholding your truth. You need to open up, tell the truth, be honest without fear of outcome and without any neediness. Don't hide your feelings from people who show you theirs.'*

> *'It happens to everyone as they grow up. You find out who you are and what you want, and then you realize that people you've known forever don't see things the way you do. So you keep the wonderful memories, but find yourself moving on.' -- Nicholas Sparks*

Focus on what you can give not what you can get. You only receive in proportion to what you give. However after taking first steps [mirror](chapter_3_action.md#on-mirroring) their behavior. There comes a time when you have to stop crossing oceans for people who wouldn’t even jump puddles for you. Run away from people who treats you like you're ordinary and be ready to loose people. You need to partner with someone who wants you to be all you can be.

### On romantic relationships

You attract what you are.

Love is what happens to men and women that don't know each other. Love doesn’t hurt, expectations do. Every person feels loved in a different form.

> *'Romance is the glamour which turns the dust of everyday life into a golden haze.' -- Elinor Glyn*

> *'The love that lasts the longest is the love that is never returned' -- W. Somerset Maugham*  

> *'The free soul is rare, but you know it when you see it basically because you feel good, very good, when you are near or with them.' -- Charles Bukowski*

> *'Love me when I least deserve it, because that's when I really need it.' -- Swedish proverb*

> *'First you see the virtues. Then the flaws. For a long and deep relationship, values must match.' -- EF*

> *'Keep separate bank accounts. Spouses should have the freedom and autonomy to buy what they want, but only after bills are automatically paid. People value things differently. Having to justify every expense makes you feel like you’re being watched. This breeds resentment. Most marriages end in divorce, most of them over money.'*

## On family and friends

Life is people and is meant to be lived in community.

> *'When everything goes to hell, the people who stand by you without flinching, they are your family.' -- Jim Butcher*

> *'Your friends are the ones that go to your funeral in a day of rain.' -- an old General*

However choose who surround you: you are the average of them. 

> *'If you're the smartest in the room, you're in the wrong room.'*  

> *'Every employee should eventually leave and start a better competitor to me. Everyone should pass me. Else I’m not the stupidest person in the room.'*

> *'When you enter a workplace, think that you will become like them and not the opposite.'*

> *'Really great people make you feel that you too can be great.' -- Mark Twain*

### How to build your «board of directors»?

- Surround yourself with people who are achieving on a higher level than you who are willing to call you out on your failures and lift you up for your successes. Once you build this infrastructure of support and accountability, your life will radically transform. If you spend the majority of your time in worlds where people are accomplishing incredible things, all of a sudden that starts to seem normal.  
- Surround yourself with people who challenge you to be better, not people who are enamored with who you already are.
- Find somebody smarter to teach you, somebody equal to challenge you and somebody less developed that you can teach. Remember that sometimes people wind up in our lives not because we judged them as high-quality individuals, but because of circumstance and nothing more.
we choose friends by proximity, not how do we feel around them, is him as invested in my well being than i am in his. focus in others people sucess but pick the right people.

You're never too old to make a friend. Look for people with the same interests as you: meetup, learn a new skill. Second step is inviting them to do something. Always be looking for a new one.
If a buddy calls and needs to get a drink, go.
I also know someone is a friend when I can go long stretches without talking to him and then we talk and its right where we left off.

Cleave from your family but come back. You need to be independent and loyal at the same time.

> *'To lose one parent may be regarded as a misfortune; to lose both looks like carelessness.' -- Oscar Wilde*

> *'Our mothers always remain the strangest, craziest people we've ever met.' -- Marguerite Duras*

Resist to temptation of working with family and friends. Peers are peers, not boss and employee: pedestals prevent friendships. Keep your friends for friendship, work with the skilled and competent. You will waste your life trying to make those around into who you want them to be.

> *'Undisturbed calmness of mind is attained by cultivating friendliness toward the happy, compassion for the unhappy, delight in the virtuous, and indifference toward the wicked.' -- Patanjali*

> *'Never put too much trust in friends, learn how to use enemies.'*  
> *'Infection: avoid the unhappy and unlucky.' -- Robert Greene (2nd and 10th law of power)*  

> *'Friendships change. Trust the friends of today as if they will be enemies tomorrow, and that of the worst kind. As this happens in reality, let it happen in your precaution.' -- Balthasar Gracian 26th*

> *'Don’t befriend fools. He that does not know a fool when he sees him is one himself: still more he that knows him but will not keep clear of him.
They are dangerous company and ruinous confidants.' -- Balthasar Gracian 22th*

> *'It is easier to forgive an enemy than to forgive a friend.' -- William Blake*

> *'When you're in jail, a good friend will be trying to bail you out. A best friend will be in the cell next to you saying, 'Damn, that was fun'.' -- Groucho Marx*

- The key to success in any relationship: personal, familial, business, etc is NOT that the two people are supportive during bad times but that the two people are supportive during GOOD times.

- Divide up your life. Spend 33% of your time around people lower than you, you can mentor them. Spend 33% of your time with people that are on your level – your friends and peers. Spend 33% of your time with people that are 10-20 years ahead of you. Those are your mentors.”

## On feedback and mentorship

> *'I’d rather have criticism from a genius than praise from an idiot.'*

Feedback speeds up improvement but only take advice from mentors.

> *'No, that is the great fallacy: the wisdom of old men. They do not grow wise. They grow careful.' -- Ernest Hemingway*

> *'He who asks is a fool for five minutes, but he who does not ask remains a fool forever.' -- Chinese proverb*

### How to find mentors?

Look for the «silver medalist». He has more availability, and sometimes, a better attitude than «the golden child».

> *'Don’t follow your mentors; follow your mentors’ mentors.' -- David Leach*

> *'Follow the thought leaders instead of the traffic leaders.'*

You should be a mentor yourself. Be [generous](/chapter_2_groups.md#on-rewards-and-generosity) and share your strengths. Impact the world. When you teach, you do something useful. When you do research, most days you don’t.

### How to mentor your kids?

> *'My advice is my autobiography instead of slogans. People relate better like that.' -- James Altucher*

> *'If you want your children to be intelligent, read them fairy tales. If you want them to be more intelligent, read them more fairy tales.' -- Albert Einstein*

Fatherhood makes you a mentor independently of your will. Don't tell your kids them how to live. Live fully and let them see. By treating everything like a major risk, we prevent kids from learning how to judge the truly dangerous, from the simply unfamiliar.

Hints:

- Generosity: «What did you do this week for somebody?»  
- Responsability: «Bedtime at 8.30 and I turn off the light or 9 and you have the responsability to turn off the light?»  
- Self improvement: «Did you give your best today?» «Ask good questions today. In future you’ll be able to know anything you want, anytime you want. So the quality of the questions you learn to ask will be more important than memorized knowledge.»  
- Autority: «Kid: why do I have to do this? You: I was a boy myself. I know what is that for you and why is important.»  
- Money management and healthy habits: pay your son for each mile he rides his bike (with interest on what he decides not to spend).  
- Fight perfectionism: «If you get a C or lower, I’ll buy you a present. If you score higher than that, I won’t buy you anything, because you won’t need it.»  
- Deal with failure: «How did you fail today?» The best gift you can give your children is failure.  
- Optimism: «You have the gift of today.»

However some people are not ready to accept your vision. And «givers» attract «takers»: remember that you [don't owe them](#on-freedom) anything.

> *'Do not teach a starving man to fish.'*

## On generosity and incentives

> *'No one has ever become poor by giving.' -- Anne Frank*

> *'He that gives should never remember and he that receives should never forget.' -- Talmud*

Always be generous. A low value gift can have the opposite effect.

> *'Always give best in class: practical luxuries make better gifts than merchandise branded with your company’s logo.'* 

> *'The last time I saw my uncle, I asked how he could be generous, and yet not be taken advantage of or stuck with horrible people. He said that what he'd learned to do was to condition whatever help he was offering on the person taking some tiny step first. Often, it was as simple as «make up a budget for you and your wife to go on a three day getaway, send it to me, and I'll write you a check». Almost everyone who was just in it for the handouts couldn't be bothered. My uncle also mixed a lot of his giving with encouraging young people's talents. He'd hire students who were excited in X, to do X for him in some way. He hired students to take photos, make music, decorate houses, build apps, archive things, paint, and who knows what else. He even hired a student to make memes. This way the students not only got money, but grew in their skills and were excited that someone wanted their work. There were, of course, some rude and uncaring people in his life. But those people didn't want to spend time with him so there was never really a conflict there.' -- danielvf_HN*

> *'My uncle died suddenly this year. He was unbelievably caring - and not just to family - but to everyone he ever met. His funeral was jam packed with everyone from homeless people to executives of multi-billion dollar companies. I always thought that his ability to always have you, and whatever you had last talked about with him, on his mind at any moment was some kind of supernatural gift. I was surprised to find out at his funeral that he actually kept an excel spreadsheet of everyone he met and what they needed and were going through. He reviewed this constantly. It didn't lessen his genuine love for everyone, just let him be a little more super human.' -- danielvf_HN*

### On punishments

Punishment only works near the situation that did that to you, often triggers a fight-or-flight response, renders us aggressive and inhibits the ability to learn new and better responses. Rewards are more effective.

Alternatives that you can try the next time you feel tempted to punish someone:
- extintion of rewards
- positively reinforcing preferred activities.
- prompting and shaping are two actions we can use together to change behavior in an iterative manner. A prompt is a cue or stimulus that encourages the desired behavior. When shaping begins, any approximation of the target response is reinforced.

<!--
- power of incentives: Ignoring incentives almost never works out well. Psychologists argue that the best way for us to learn complex behaviors is via continuous reinforcement, in which the desired behavior is reinforced every time it’s performed. continuous reinforcement |> intermitent reinforcement

- Generosity without Expectation is Sexy. It means that your thoughts, words, and actions are all in congruence. you don’t live a life that is incongruent with what you want to make others happy. You live a life of congruence where everything is in line. This is the pathway to true power. Be generous from a place of abundance, where you are giving because you are already so full, not from a place of scarcity where you are kind because you want something in return.
- The people who love you most can care less about how much money you make or what gifts you can send them. What they really want is your time, presence and attention.

# 2.2 - On interaction: drawbacks

## On conflicts

> *'Avoiding conflict will not keep peace, will rot it. Rotten peace builds resentment.' -- EF*

Don't avoid *relevant* conflicts. Small (but relevant) conflicts will grow into big conflicts.  
Neutrality is not possible. Anyway preserve your [freedom](chapter_1_self.md#on-freedom) as much as possible.

> *'I am either part of the solution or part of the problem.'*

> *'Well-kept gardens die by pacifism.'*

### On conflict resolution

- Offer value from the start: Set the stage by coming in smiling, pay a compliment, make a joke and shake hands.
- Show some empathy and use “we” to show you’re on the same team.  
- Take responsibility  
- Bring options to the table: an high-value person always knows what they want before they come to the table. Understand also that it’s easier to negotiate down

## On criticism and envy

> *'Great spirits have always found violent opposition from mediocrities. The latter cannot understand it when a man does not thoughtlessly submit to hereditary prejudices but honestly and courageously uses his intelligence.' -- Albert Einstein*

> *'Great minds discuss ideas. Average minds discuss events. Small minds discuss people.' -- Henry Thomas Buckle*

Treat your haters like toddlers.

Outliers inspire envy. Once they stop talking to you, they start to talk about you. [Intelligence](chapter_appendix.md#on-intelligence), [wealth](chapter_appendix.md#on-wealth), [ambition](chapter_appendix.md#on-ambition-and-motivation), [fame](chapter_appendix.md#on-fame), [luck](chapter_appendix.md#on-luck), [beauty](chapter_appendix.md#on-beauty), [health](chapter_appendix.md#on-stress-and-health), freedom and a mix of them ([lifestyle](chapter_appendix.md#on-lifestyle)) are the main triggers.

> *'Remember if people talk behind your back, it only means you are two steps ahead.' -- Fannie Flagg*

> *'They called her witch because she knew how to heal herself.' -- Te' V. Smith (Here we are, reflections of a God gone mad)*

> *'Think as you like but behave like others.'  
'Never appear too perfect.' -- Robert Greene (38th and 46th law of power)*

> *'If A is a success in life, then A = X + Y + Z. Work is X; Y is play; and Z is keeping your mouth shut.' -- Albert Einstein*

When people criticize your life they are speaking about their fears and limitations not yours. Only take advice from [those achieving what you want to achieve](chapter_2_groups.md##on-feedback-and-mentorship). Ignore and be flattered by the rest. Never hate people who are jealous of you. Respect their jealousy, they think that you're better than them.

> *'The dogs bark but the caravan moves on.' -- Arab proverb*  

> *'It is not greed that drives the world, but envy.' -- Warren Buffet*

### On blindspots

However beware of blindspots, not all criticism is envy. When somebody says something bad about you, is negativity. When everyone says it, is advice.

> *'Let me never fall into the vulgar mistake of dreaming that I am persecuted whenever I am contradicted.' -- Ralph Waldo Emerson*

> *'Gold rushes make the shovel sellers rich, not the gold seekers.'*

### What is stupidity and how to deceive it?

> *'Stupidity is overlooking or dismissing crucial information.' -- Adam Robinson*

Stupidity is the cost of intelligence operating in a complex environment and it’s almost inevitable. Most people don't actually think, they just take their first thought and go.

> *'Nothing is more terrible than to see ignorance in action.' -- Goethe*

> *'I have long held that stupidity is very largely the result of fear leading to mental inhibitions.' -- Bertie Russell*

> *'There are no smart people or stupid people, just people being smart or being stupid. Being smart means thinking things through trying to find the real answer, not the first answer. Being stupid means avoiding thinking by jumping to conclusions. Jumping to a conclusion is like quitting a game: you lose by default. That’s why saying «I don’t know» is usually smart, because it’s refusing to jump to a conclusion. So when someone says «They are so stupid!», it means they’ve stopped thinking.'*	

> *'I find for myself that my first thought is never my best thought. My first thought is always someone else's; it's always what I've already heard about the subject, always the conventional wisdom.' -- William Deresiewicz*

> *'If everybody is thinking alike, then somebody isn't thinking.' -- George S. Patton Jr.*  
> *'When you do as everyone else does, don't be surprised when you get what everyone else gets.' -- Peter Kaufman*  
> *'Great things are not accomplished by those who yield to trends and fads and popular opinion.' -- Jack Kerouac*

> *'If people around you don’t think what you’re doing is a bit strange, maybe it’s not strange enough.' -- Patrick Collison*  
> *'Just because people tell you it can’t be done, that doesn’t necessarily mean that it can’t be done. It just means that they can’t do it.' -- Anders Hejlsberg*  

Despite being easier to recognise stupidity in others than ourselves, don’t take for granted that others are acting stupid. Common sense is not so common.

> *'Don't ever take a fence down until you know the reason why it was put up.' -- John F. Kennedy, paraphrasing G.K.Chesterton*

> *'Life's hard. It's even harder when you're stupid.' -- John Wayne*

> *'Two economists are walking along the street, and one says, «Hey, someone dropped a $20 bill!» and the other says, «Well, it can’t be a real $20 bill because someone would have picked it up already.»'*

### How to judge a man?

Society judges people by what they can do for others. But we judge ourselves by our thoughts.

Every word someone says is the tip of the iceberg. Underneath that word are thoughts, fears, emotions. Underneath those emotions is history and experiences. A single word is the final outcome of all of that history.

> *'Judge a man by his questions, not by his answers.' -- Voltaire*

> *'It isn't what we say or think that defines us, but what we do.' -- Jane Austen*

> *'We should not judge people by their peak of excellence; but by the distance they have traveled from the point where they started.' -- Henry Ward Beecher*

> *'Whenever you feel like criticizing any one... just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.' -- F. Scott Fitzgerald*

<!--
- changing course is hard and this scares us so we look around and try to copy the courses other people took
- If everyone is buying houses at the same time, the price of houses will go up too high and nobody will make any money.

> *'Whenever people agree with me I always feel I must be wrong.' --  Oscar Wilde*
From Scott Adams (Dilbert):
> Rational People: Use data and reason to arrive at truth. (This group is mostly imaginary.)
> Word-Thinkers: Use labels, word definitions, and analogies to create the illusion of rational thinking. This group is 99% of the world.
> Persuaders: Use simplicity, repetition, emotion, habit, aspirations, visual communication, and other tools of persuasion to program other people and themselves. This group is about 1% of the population and effectively control the word-thinkers of the world.

As humans, we are tribal by nature. Our natural default is to see ourselves as part of some group that’s struggling against some other group(s) at all times. And once we’re part of our little group, our little tribe, we adopt all sorts of biases and preferences. We construct belief systems that justify our group’s power and superiority. We create tests of whether other people are “true” and “pure” members of our group, and we either shame any “non-believers” into conformity or simply expel them from the tribe.

Once a philosophy goes tribal, its beliefs no longer exist to serve some moral principle, but rather they exist to serve the promotion of the group.

But the problem is that, like I said, feminism, in the process of enacting all of the progress of the last 50 years, became more than a philosophy—it became an institution. And institutions are always primarily interested in sustaining themselves first and engaging with the world as it is second.

The way you destroy stereotypes is by being the contradiction of the stereotype. These are the real activists. This is where real progress happens. Yes, women still face stereotypes and poor treatments in these industries. But this is the trench today’s feminists should be fighting in. This is where they should be making their push -- and not by talking about it online, but by actually being there.

And once your philosophy has inverted upon itself, it becomes corrupt. Just like the old communist societies of the 20th century, once you set out to provide perfect equality for everybody, you achieve the exact opposite. What was once progressive becomes regressive. You become so busy policing people’s thoughts and opinions that you lose track of what actually matters.

## On society and politics

> *'For the friends: everything. For the others: the law.' -- paraphrased from Machiavelli*

Politicians don't like risk. Decisions are made on the lowest risk of offending anybody.

Politicians don't get educated. They get bought. To reduce corruption diminish people involved on analogic processes.

> *'Popper came to the seemingly paradoxical conclusion that in order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant of intolerance.'*

> *'If you want to lead, simply act with confidence and others around you will pick up on that energy and fall in line. No explicit statements needed. If someone fails to fall in line, either your leadership needs improvement or you need to excise them from your group.'*

Leaders are team makers: there are no bad teams, only bad leaders. 

Being a leader is different from being a boss: it requires to be a manager and a psychotherapist. Leadership is based on emotional intelligence, people don't follow robots. The secret to motivating people and maintaining their morale is to get them to think less about themselves and more about the group. Leadership is the ability to locate yourself. 

> *'A leader is best when people barely know he exists, when his work is done, his aim fulfilled, they will say: we did it ourselves.' -- Lao Tzu*

> *'Be royal in your own fashion: act like a king to be treated like one.' -- Robert Greene (34th law of power)*

> *'The only thing that gives orders is balls.' -- Tony Montana*

People want leadership positions because they want autonomy and influence. Influence is more powerful than money. The reason millionaires are depressed is that they don’t know the difference.

> *'The person who clears the path ultimately controls its direction, just as the canvas shapes the painting.' -- Ryan Holiday*

Hints:

- Know when to speak and when don't.  
- Know how to create a vision of where they want to go. 'I’m not here to help; I’m here to learn.'  
- Are part of the team. 'No one is smarter than a small group.'  
- Make people feel as part of a family.  
- Power is having options than you can metabolize. Power is making decisions.  
- Good leaders are leaders that grow up in the hierarchy.  
- In order to be successful you will probably have to build a team of successful people to support you. You need them to be paid well and well taken care of. You must make it easy for them to succeed and you must teach them how to do it. You won’t do it alone. Put employees before customers.  
- Always be clear and specific about what you expect from other people. You can not expect from them what you haven’t articulated…usually many times and in writing. Also plan for them to fail you.  
- When someone is out of line, don’t let it slide too far. If you let someone treat your poorly for too long in order to avoid conflict, things will get so bad that you then have to have a huge fight in order to correct them. What could have been very small is now a real problem that may compromise your relationship, business.

<!--
We advance the welfare of others — often unconsciously — by sharing resources, cooperating, and collaborating within a social structure. As perhaps an unintended consequence, we find ourselves gaining power. Most often, this power is something that’s given to us, and not something we set out to seize. This runs directly counter to the popular belief that power is attained by becoming a Machiavellian super villain and using force, manipulation, deception, and strategic ruthlessness to take it at the expense of others. Individuals demonstrating value to other individuals — or companies demonstrating value to a society — gain power as a direct result.

Beth Comstock:

2. Organize Around Information Flows: In the digital age, information moves fast. To keep up with information flows, you have to ditch hierarchy. There’s no room for bureaucracy. It’s about openness, candor, radical feedback and full transparency. If you organize your organization around these tenets, you’ll thrive.

3. Empower Individuals: Build a team of people who are prepared for change and empower them to do great work. The question is: how do you get people to get excited to grab power and go for it? More autonomy.

4. Define your company’s “MO” -- Mindset Orientation: Mindset is everything. As a leader, you must provide the vision and then allow your teams to figure their way out. Create a mindset that incentivizes them to do what they need to do the fastest, best way they can. It means they may fail. You should encourage them to fail fast, learn from their mistakes, and keep going. At GE, this process is called FastWorks, and it’s built on lean startup methodology.

5. Establish Feedback Loops: Exponential leaders must both give and receive feedback – and importantly, they have to actually use it. Beth offers three ideas here:

First: “One of the things we’ve done at GE is we’ve actually gotten rid of our employee performance reviews. Anyone in the organization can give anyone feedback. I just did a Facebook Live event last week and one of my young colleagues in the company gave me some feedback. It wasn’t so good… ‘You weren’t looking at the camera at the right point. You looked like you were distracted.’ It was hard feedback to receive, but it was encouraged.”

“What is the one thing that is true that you think I don’t want to hear?” Beth comments that you’ll be amazed what you’ll learn. It’s extremely valuable.

Third: Rather than doing long, convoluted employee surveys, stick to a simple feedback mechanism: Continue, or consider. You get feedback that says either “Continue doing X” or “Consider changing X to make it better.” It’s really simple, fast and actionable.

6. Get Used to Living in the In-Between: Exponential leaders are comfortable with ambiguity and uncertainty. This is going to be key to survive the change that is coming.

7. Mash Up Minds and Machines: Exponential leaders use technology to their advantage, combining the power of computing and data with human leadership.

8. Prioritize Innovation and Observe Patterns That Block It: Innovating is really hard. Good leaders understand they have to navigate the tension. Sometimes leaders give up, and they don’t hold their team accountable for growing. They themselves back off on it. And so is it any wonder that the people on the team deprioritize innovating?.

1. Always be an Ambassador for Your Team, Innovation Happens Everywhere.

3. Once a Decision is Made, It is Supported. Period. This is really important. Once a decision is made in a meeting, there must be no second-guessing of that decision after the fact. Sue explains, “When we walk out of that room, and you’ve had all the chance to actually defend your position to make the decision, it’s time to start executing. That’s it.” If you need to change a strategy, use data from implementation to support your argument and bring it up in the next decision-making meeting.

4. Proactive Problem Management – Go Directly to the Source: As complexity increases, so too does the potential for conflict or confusion. As an exponential leader, you must be proactive in managing this. Sue’s strategy is simple and clear: “Go to the source, directly to the source. Don’t complain to managers or others before you’ve gone to the person first to resolve the conflict.”

7. You Can’t Delegate Culture: This is absolutely critical for exponential leaders. Culture can make or break a company, and therefore it a) must be very high on a leader’s list of priorities and b) must come from the top. Leaders can’t delegate culture. Sue goes on, “Leaders are the culture bearers, the torchkeepers of culture in our companies. They might have change agents, or those that actually help them amplify their culture, but the leader cannot delegate culture. This is a truth that a lot of us forget because we’re so busy. Employees and teams really want to see it from their leaders. They want to hear the talk, they want to watch them walk the talk, all the time.” Interestingly, while leaders cannot delegate culture creation, they can delegate culture keeping.

Just last week I reminded my team to leave in all internal key Meetings one seat free -- for our customer ... like Jeff Bezos practiced it in all Amazon meetings.

There are three keys: honesty, effectiveness, and efficiency.

- A group of 10 people within a large organization is a kind of fake tribe. The number of people you interact with is about right. But something is missing: individual initiative. Tribes of hunter-gatherers have much more freedom. The leaders have a little more power than other members of the tribe, but they don't generally tell them what to do and when the way a boss can. In the first couple weeks of working on their own startup they seem to come to life, because finally they're working the way people are meant to.
- Another thing you notice when you see animals in the wild is that each species thrives in groups of a certain size. A herd of impalas might have 100 adults; baboons maybe 20; lions rarely 10. Humans also seem designed to work in groups, and what I've read about hunter-gatherers accords with research on organizations and my own experience to suggest roughly what the ideal size is: groups of 8 work well; by 20 they're getting hard to manage; and a group of 50 is really unwieldy

## On teams: management and delegation

> *'Don’t postpone to tomorrow what other people can do for you today.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.' -- African proverb*

Managing is delegating. Your speed as a manager is the speed of your team.

Be productive, not cheap. Stop dicking around trying to figure stuff out that someone else already knows. Instead of generalizing and saying «management is useless», it's more correct to say «bad management is counterproductive». The only reason there’s so many awful managers is that people like you refuse to do the job.

> *'A manager should make himself 2 questions a day: «What is important to accomplish?» and «Where was I uncomfortable the day before?». The speed that you offload your stuff will be the speed of your team.'*

> *'Your productivity as a manager is measured as the productivity of your team. Being seated making stuff is not productive.
The key principle is putting your team’s productivity first. Remember, you are a communication hub and a multiplier. Think about the things you can delegate vs. the things that only you can do. If you truly work for your people instead of hiding at your desk, just tell yourself: what I accomplished today is not yet visible, but it will be.'*

### How to give feedback?

> *'The goal is to move everyone up from «unconfident and incompetent» to «confident and competent».' -- exelius_HN*

For that you need to [communicate](#on-communication). Spend one hour a day just talking to your people and everything will be OK. 

You can't make any judgement of the worker without detailed understanding of the specifics of the work. 
Ask instead of telling. If you're certain the delivered work is not good enough give a reason.

> *'«Is that the best you can do?»  
«Interesting, how do you feel about it?»  
«What does your team think?»  
«Why did you decide to do X in that order?» This creates a dialog, instead of a debate where each side first stakes out positions. Lead your people to discover what you would have suggested. Smart people will get to the same place you were going, or if you are humble enough to listen, you may learn something.'*

> *'«Can you take another look at this for XYZ reasons?». This gives the employee ownership of the final deliverable, while still prompting them to deal with problems they overlooked. «Because» is a great motivator.'*

> *'Praise by name, criticize by category.' -- Warren Buffet*

However gaining an understanding and giving appropriate feedback makes your juniors feel like what they are doing is important. Pounding directives down or not giving any direction are demotivators. Data shows people want more feedback but monthly, not daily.

> *'Delegating isn’t as easy as it looks. It takes some real chutzpah to make someone do your work for insufficient compensation while you rake in the big bucks.'*

Hints on meetings:

- Start a meeting with an overachieving question: «how can we raise sales by 12%?».  
- Jeff Bezos famously banned PowerPoints in favor of “narratives” — four-to-six page memos that Amazon employees read and discuss together in meetings. This format, Bezos felt, would lead to clearer and more collaborative decision-making, and avoid the same old thinking fostered by PowerPoint.  
- On a meeting do not share your opinion on possible solutions before asking for input from your team. Lower ranked people should speak first. Everybody the right to their opinion and not copying others' opinion.  
- Switch my default to “no” for all meetings. If I can’t say no, I schedule the meeting for the afternoon. If I have to do it in person, I make it close to my office.

- So what makes organizations productive? Making hard decisions. -- scott-belsky (behance creator)
- elephant list: Productivity happens at two levels: the individual and the collective. I’ve talked a lot about what I do on a personal level to be productive, but my other fascination is with collective productivity. As companies grow and age, they accumulate organizational debt.Organizational debt is the accumulation of decisions that should have been made but weren't. Decisions are hard to make– a simple decision might mean one team gains while another loses. Sign-offs by multiple teams may be necessary. As a company grows and ages, it becomes even more difficult to make decisions and take meaningful action.The problem is, neglecting to make a decision causes its own set of problems. Without a decision, there’s no movement. Things stay the same. People stop talking about potential opportunities because they don’t feel they can make a change or impact. People within the organization start assuming that they're stuck with artificial constraints.In order to combat this lack of decision-making, I’ve taken to calling out the “elephants in the room” -- those things that everyone sees but no one wants to address. Identifying and calling out elephants is one of my favorite things to do because once they’re out in the open, we can develop strategies to eliminate them.What’s the biggest item to make a decision on that we’re potentially avoiding or we need leadership’s input on? One of my jobs as a manager is to do things only I can do. This is a way to make the most use of my time. A huge part of my job is calling out these elephants.Every product, every team, and every company has elephants. Every startup founder I work with as an advisor and investor carries around elephants, as well. I love sussing out what those elephants are and pushing them into the spotlight so everyone else can see it. In a large company, you often need to persuade people to take action. For example, I often need to convince my colleagues that addressing an elephant is a top priority.If everyone else is being reactive to what comes to them as opposed to being proactive in what matters most to them, then you stand to make an impact if you hold time for thinking.I conduct audits of my time.

- Try to replace the above phrases with "one option is to..." and change your thinking to complete the thought in a way that makes sense. Avoid picking favorite solutions and presenting them as the clear winner or only option. It'll get you thinking in terms of pros and cons and how to persuade other people by appealing to their point of view. It will make you appear more level-headed and capable of making decisions that are good for the business. It'll also remind you of (and force you to fully consider) the frequently hidden option that's often forgotten when presenting a new idea or direction, which is the status quo.

I’m a strategist, not a politician. My job sometimes is to say the thing they don’t want to hear.

> *'Always tell us the bad news promptly. Good news can wait' -- Berkshire policy*
	
“A chain is only as strong as its weakest link”

I divide my officers into four groups. There are clever, diligent, stupid, and lazy officers. Usually two characteristics are combined. Some are clever and diligent -- their place is the General Staff. The next lot are stupid and lazy -- they make up 90 percent of every army and are suited to routine duties. Anyone who is both clever and lazy is qualified for the highest leadership duties, because he possesses the intellectual clarity and the composure necessary for difficult decisions. One must beware of anyone who is stupid and diligent -- he must not be entrusted with any responsibility because he will always cause only mischief.

## On hiring and being hired

> *'He who works with his hands is a laborer.  
He who works with his hands and his head is a craftsman.  
He who works with his hands and his head and his heart is an artist.' -- St. Francis of Assisi*

Trial most but only hire likable persons that «get shit done».

Your goal in business should be to «fire» yourself and hire people who are better at your job than you are. To build an empire you must become a master at finding and hiring talent.

> *'Two valid methods: hiring on culture contribution and hiring on culture matching.'*

> *'Bad professionals make money off their customers, good professionals make money for their customers.' -- Jacques Mattheij*

> *'We value “T-shaped” people. That is, people who are both generalists (highly skilled at a broad set of valuable things—the top of the T) and also experts (among the best in their field within a narrow discipline—the vertical leg of the T) (...) An expert who is too narrow has difficulty collaborating. A generalist who doesn’t go deep enough in a single area ends up on the margins, not really contributing as an individual. Where you choose to be deep should be an area of interest to you and which the market values.' -- Valve employee book*

### How to attract and keep talented people?

Respect them. You'll never respect them if you don't reward them accordingly.  
Usually people leave managers, not companies.

> *'Create contracts that build up «golden handcuffs» offering your new hires the ability to earn as much as they want, provided that they are earning you even more income in the process.'*

HOWEVER good employeees are not easy to find.

> *'Always look for internal spies, people in the enemy camp who are dissatisfied and have an ax to grind.'*

> *'They don’t want to lose you. They don’t want to lose the negotiation. And they don’t want to restart the hiring process. Hiring is a long and expensive process.'*

When applying for a job be more of a consultant than an applicant. Hints:

- Your resume should tell the reader what is going to make you more valuable to the company than the next person. You’ll show that with your experience.
DON’T tell about your responsibilities. Everyone who is doing your type of job has those responsibilities. Tell HOW you accomplished your responsibilities better than the next person. ie. Your a car salesperson. You are responsible for selling cars (so is every other car salesperson). You sold more cars than anyone else in the dealership for six months out of the last year. Which person would you hire.  
- Most reviewers are only going to understand two skill levels: still learning the skill or confident in the skill.

<!--
- I'm on a mix of hourly and value based, will try to change from 50/50 to 10/90 in favor of value based next year.

If your manager or employer says “No” the first time around (and this is very likely), don’t get discouraged. Simply thank them for their time and ask them “What specific outcomes would be required for me to receive this raise within the next 3-6 months?” If they can’t answer this question, you should probably find another employer.

people want freedom to choose their process

The most important lessons I learned were to remember that I'd hired them to do things that I could not. As such, they knew their job better than I did. If I could have done it myself, I'd not have had to hire them.
Hire people you can trust. You have to trust them to be adults. Give them clear goals and then get the hell out of the way so that they can do their job.
Give them the tools they ask for, not the tools a vendor suggested. They have a reason they asked for a proprietary compiler, get it for them.
Respect goes a long way and begins in the recruitment phase. It surely doesn't end there. To get respect, you have to give respect.
Train, train, train. If you treat your employee right, you can absolutely train them and not worry about them being poached. Salary is actually a small part of overhead. Pay them well and treat them well. Our print room cost more than a senior employee. There's no reason to pay crap wages.
At the same time, wages aren't everything. Everyone wants to make good money but when you're already assured of making good money, other things start to count. Help your employees in their goals. If you have a QA that wants to move to dev, don't offer to pay back their educational expenses, but pay their expenses outright, pay for their child care, pay for their books, and keep paying their salary while they work a reduced schedule. Really, if you're treating them right, they won't just up and go to a new company after you've trained them.
I can go on, but there's a few things I've learned.

Tip #3: A lot of portfolios are used both for job applications and freelance clients. Don’t do this. The best practice is for a professional to design separate portfolios for each of those audiences. Every little detail matters. Here is the toughest point for a lot of people: you can’t control what your reviewer sees on your portfolio.

"Estimativas são Promessas. Promessas devem ser cumpridas.".
In a nutshell, you can never give an estimate that is "correct". If you could, it would not be an "estimate", it would be a "prediction".
Therefore, there is zero correlation between an estimate and the actual outcome.

If you're a knowledge worker decisions are your product. Milton Friedman, the economist, wrote: “The best measure of quality thinking is your ability to accurately predict the consequences of your ideas and subsequent actions.”

There's nothing wrong in specialization -- it's how we stay sane. A very workable and easy to understand formula early in your career is specialize in two things; you don't have to be better at X and better at Y than everyone you meet, you have to be "better at X than anyone who is better at Y" and "better at Y than anyone who is better at X." This is very, very achievable, regardless of how highly competent your local set of peers is.

autentic pride (genuine) vs hubristic pride (egotistic)
-
Startups are (by necessity) filled with generalists; big companies are filled with specialists.
companies hire for a problem and not general optimizations. Even if they need a generalist.

Try consulting or entrepreneurship.
When you sell your time, you need to fit into a role that someone can comprehend and already knows they need.
When you sell your ability to deliver results, nobody asks about your skillset.

Decide in advance what your time is worth. Do not let others tell you how much you will be paid. They may make offers, but it is never their decision. It is yours.

## On career

> *'The moment you [rigidly follow a plan](chapter_3_action.md#on-change-and-adapting) set in your youth, you lock yourself into a position, and the times will ruthlessly pass you by.' -- Robert Greene*

Avoid the trap of following one set career path. Focus on being useful, it will be easier to pivot when needed. If your job doesn't require originality, next decade you might not have it.

> *'The interesting jobs are the ones that you make up.' -- Chris Young*

> *'I always advise young people to become good public speakers (top 25%). Anyone can do it with practice. If you add that talent to any other, suddenly you’re the boss of the people who have only one skill. Or get a degree in business on top of your degree. Suddenly you’re in charge, or maybe you’re starting your own company using your combined knowledge.'*

Being an employee is long-term risky. In an economy with shrinking corporations, more outsourcing, more automation, every month you risk being fired. The economy forces all the risk on employees who have no control over their futures.

> *'The boss wants the most sophisticated talent he can get, and he doesn't want to pay anything for it. Every penny he pays, and every second of your life he doesn't get for it, is a failure in his eyes.'*

> *'I work for money, if you want loyalty hire a dog.'*

> *'You dont get anywhere, and for more money, sitting in the same seat.'*

> *'My luggage is always ready.' -- Jorge Jesus (soccer coach)*

### Is it better to be good at many things or great at one thing?

- To be an entrepreneur you need to know a little about a lot of things.  
- To be employed, if you pick the right specialization (specialization is dangereous), you'll do better as a specialist.

### How to keep a job or advance career?

Knowledge + metaknowledge (instead of asking, journal higher hierarchy than you)

> *'I had a manager who once said the people who were terminated were those who question too much and do too little.'*

> *'While deep work will promote you, shallow work will only prevent you from being fired.'  
'Career capital is the unique skills that make you rare and valuable'  
'Be so good that they cannot ignore you' -- Cal Newport*

> *'Your income is directly proportional to the need for what you do and your ability to do it.' -- Jim Rohn*

- Become the best at one specific thing.  
- Become very good (top 25%) at two or more things.

> *'Your work is the greatest mean at your disposal for expressing your social intelligence.'*

> *'For every million people that want to be a successful musician, only one is going to achieve it. If you’re going to be that one, you can’t do what everyone else is doing. Whatever you do, it’ll be creative, efficient, and effective. That’s my definition of resourceful. It means making something happen, instead of saying you can’t. It means accessing all the people and skills you know, including the ones that take extra effort. It usually means doing things for free, but can also mean spending a little money to save a lot of time. It means using a shortcut around obstacles, getting in through a back door, bending the rules, and never waiting for permission. It means asking for help, but not waiting for help. So why do I hate to admit this? Because I love how the internet has made it possible for anyone to get successful anywhere. I love the idea of living in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by nature, yet being connected to the world. But still, when I look at the facts, it’s impossible to deny. Actually living in the big city, and being in the middle of where everything is happening, will help your career the most. Being elsewhere won’t hurt you, but it won’t help.' -- Derek Sivers*

### How to «pivot» career?

Cultivate a relevant skill stack. Capitalism rewards things that are both rare and valuable. You make yourself rare by combining two or more “pretty goods” until no one else has your mix.

- use the transportable skills that you have: soft skills (e.g. persuasive communication: pitching and change somebody's opinion, emotional intelligence, ability to read the room, ability to build trust, ability to retain talent) and hard skills.
write a pitch, are u persuasive, can you change somebody else opinion. making a 2 minute youtube, etc.  
- find the people that were working for them. top leaders ask for help and give knowledge away. more open source.  
- take risks to boost your immune system.  
- Pivoting is a mindset. Pivoting isn’t easy, even if you know it’s right.  
- You will either pivot or get pivoted.

> *'People pivot combining two skills. E.g. Data Scientist is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician.'*

> *'Jobs are like clothes. There is no "wrong job". There are jobs which fit now.'*

### How to get employers feedback?
 
If you ask them why did they asked you for an interview, they will describe your strengths.

<!--
- differentiate yourself / volunteer for assignments / becoming the go to guy for some questions
- three-paths-in-the-tech-industry-founder-executive-or-employee
- trabalhar de porta aberta vs trabalhar à porta fechada
- Oh, this is an easy one. When people say a child is talented they mean he or she is a good learner. But a talented adult is a good do-er. High potential people who fail to make an impact are stuck in child-mode, because that is what they were always praised for.
- work smart not harder but hard still.
- Be a jack-of-all-trades and a master of one.
- trade-able skills: figure out what skills you already have that you can charge for
- Always Focus on Delivering More Value than Expected
- finding and winning a great job is a competitive subject. it's not very correlated with luck.
- Your Success is Someone Else’s Miracle
- find your secret sauce and NAME it. whats unique. you need to get people attention
- ask what's your secret mission -- something you want to do here that another person is interested also\

- you are a learning machine. Not an occupation.
- Ideas are welcomed, execution is worshiped

- recruiting better than hiring: find a place where you can do a good job
- its good to be better, but is better to be different.

- Working hard for something we don’t care about is called stress; working hard for something we love is called passion.
- My passionate interests have changed 30 times since I graduated college.
- You don’t give a damn about that job. It’s someone else’s dream. specialized jobs are boring. I seem to get satisfaction only from making stuff. Or maybe a better description would be solving problems and making improvements.

- read the classics: deliberately being 3 years behind on the latest technologies is a really good way to stay employable without driving yourself mad keeping up with the latest and greatest. After 3 years, the flash-in-the-pans and the duds have been winnowed out and you can just concentrate on the stuff which will earn you paying gigs.

100% time -> 100% results  
20% time -> 80%results  
So: 100% on one thing = 80% on 5 things!  

> *'How to return to an workplace:  
- reframe your experience. Use today and future jargons. Make your homework.  
- refresh your skill set, if you got rusty.  
- career ecosystems, get back into them, reconnect.  
- reboot self confidence. Surround yourself with confident people.'

- Happy, Smart, and Useful
- look at situations as systems. i help to create systems.

## On hierarchy

Everything is hierarchy.  
Only comedians can speak the truth without consequences.

> *'Never outshine the master.'  
'Know who you’re dealing with: do not offend the wrong person.'  
'Avoid stepping into a great man’s shoes.' -- Robert Greene (1st, 9th and 41st law of power)*

> *'Weak managers believe if an employee becomes irreplaceable, they have become expendable. Keeping employees dispensable is more important than keeping skilled talent. Their actions aren't random or stupid.'*

> *'Higher the status, more exposure to parasites whose transmission isn't environmentally mediated.'*

> *'The highest form of the art of power is the ability to distinguish the wolves from the lambs, the foxes from hares, the hawks from vultures.'*

> *'Social cartography: who's the decision maker, to whom people are speaking and who is speaking.'*

HOWEVER... don't vow to the gatekeepers. Most people are basically afraid of their superiors. Someone’s position does not make them important. You can replace them as quickly as they can replace you. It's a business relationship.

> *'No hay prepotencia más ridícula que la que se destila de la creencia de que recopilar talento ajeno es un talento.' -- Jorge Luis Borges*

> *'Es triste que gente con talento y sin dinero tenga que depender de gente con dinero y sin talento.'*

> *'No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.' -- Eleanor Roosevelt*
