# 3.1 - On preparing action

### On creativity, vision and ideas

We don’t have an «imagination» we have a memory. Creative minds are rarely tidy.

> *'Those who do not want to imitate anything, produce nothing.' -- Salvador Dali*

> *'The new is the forgotten because everything has already happened.' -- Arturo Pérez Reverte*

> *'The secret to creativity is knowing how to hide your sources.' -- Albert Einstein*

> *'Good artists copy; great artists steal.' -- Steve Jobs & others*

> *'To invent, you need a good imagination and a pile of junk.' -- Thomas Edison*

Creativity is a muscle - you have to practice it every day.  
Once it stays the same, it's no longer creative. [Without new experiences, your soul rots](chapter_1_self.md#on-comfort-and-risk).

> *'Good ideas are a numbers game. You need a lot of bad ones to get one good.'*

> *'We can’t solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them.'*

How to find ideas?  
Creativity is born out of free time, play and boredom lead to creativity.

> *'If you accept conventional wisdom from conventional people living conventional lives. Can you expect to be anything other than conventional?'*

> *'Ideas by themselves are roughly worthless. There's no market for them. There's no place where one can go and buy an idea. Describing your idea in detail doesn't mean other people will copy it. First they'll have to be convinced it's a good idea. If you ever tried to change anyone else's mind you know by now how hard that is. Not even founders themselves can predict how well their own ideas will do. And even if people are convinced your idea is a good idea, they'll still have to compare it to the existing idea they are already working on and see which one they're more likely to do well with.'*

> *'Far better an approximate answer to the right question, which is often vague, than an exact answer to the wrong question, which can always be made precise.' -- John Tukey*

> *'Ignorance is a bliss, gives you freedom to think about stuff. being ignorant about the market and the «right way» to do things allows them to come up with creative solutions to problems that experienced veterans would never have thought of. Do not see your ignorance as a curse, see it as a blessing.'*

> *'The secret to doing good research is always to be a little underemployed. You waste years by not being able to waste hours.' -- Amos Tversky*

> *'I cultivate empty space as a way of life for the creative process.' -- Josh Waitzkin*

> *'Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn't really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while.'*

> *'Finding a good idea: idea sex, mix stuff.'*

How to judge ideas?

> *'Peers (fellow creators) are the best judging ideas. Managers are the worse because they are outcome attached: they will regret more a false positive than a false negative.'*

> *'Ideas are not worth a damn thing. Only execution is. Forget all of your ideas. Instead, worry about transforming yourself into the kind of person who can execute and bring ideas to life.'*

Creativity is linked to autonomy.

> *'Creativity and critical thinking:  
In subordinate position it gets you labelled a dreamer, a weirdo, or an idiot.  
In executive position, visionary, maverick, multidisciplinary thinker, etc.  
You can only truly creative in a position with autonomy, so you either climb the ladder or start your own thing.'*

<!--
The mind that opens to a new idea never returns to its original size. -- Albert Einstein

Play is a gateway to possibility. Einstein called play the essential feature of productive thought. Seneca was also a fan of combinatorial play.

> *'Moments of originality and moments of conformity.'*

Ideas, then good ideas, then execution, then Do-ing, then networking, then idea sex, then turning an idea into a future vision, then monetizing the idea. Then more ideas. -- altucher

It's true that some ideas are better than other ones. But movement, action is the only thing that matters in the end. Because the right idea not executed is worth nothing, but a mediocre one well taken care of and well executed can prove to be worth much.
Ideas mature, evolve. They smash themselves against real life, sometimes for good

### On analysis

Analysis is an art, not a science.

> *'To find deep truths intuition is better than statistics.'*

> *'Statistics are like bikinis. What they reveal is suggestive, but what they conceal is vital.' -- Levenstein*

> *'«Dictator's dilemma»: when the vote goes 79% – 21% for some candidate we presume it was fair and represents a popular mandate. But when his excellency and Great Father of his People, gets 97% of the vote we say that is BS.'*

And, as such, error-prone:  
a) randomness: most facts are a «tell» but some are just random.

> *'Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.' -- Sigmund Freud*

> *'Never assume that what people say or do in a particular moment is a statement of their permanent desires.'*

> *'Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts.' -- ALbert Einstein*

It is possible to view this as an isolated event or a trend

c) [being deceived](#on-deceiveness);

> *'Don't tell me what you value. Show me your budget, and I'll tell you what you value.' -- Joe Biden quoting his father*

b) and specially, bias, will trigger miscalculations.

> *'What Susie says of Sally says mores about Susie than of Sally.'*

> *'Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth.'*

> *'The hardest thing to explain is the glaringly evident that everyone has decided not to see.' -- Ayn Rand*

> *'Each generation imagines itself to be more intelligent than the one that went before it, and wiser than the one that comes after it.' -- Orwell*

> *'Experiment and theory often show remarkable agreement when performed in the same laboratory' -- Daniel Bershader*

> *'Have you ever noticed that anybody driving slower than you is an idiot, and anyone going faster than you is a maniac?' -- George Carlin*

<!--
> *'I look for ways of changing my mind.' -- Chalie Munger*
-->

One of the great problems with filters is our human tendency to think that what we see is all there is, without realizing that what we see is being filtered.

Be specially careful when facing new ideas.  
Too much info is also prone to bias: you'll always find confirmation to your pre-existing beliefs.

> *'Nothing is as simple at seems at first, or as hopeless as it seems in the middle, or as finished as it seems in the end.'*

> *'I am both worse and better than you thought.' -- Sylvia Plath*

> *'You always get exaggerated notions of things you don’t know anything about.' -- Albert Camus*

> *'An unfamiliar city is a fine thing. That’s the time and place when you can suppose that all of the people you meet are nice.' -- Louis Céline*

HINTS:

> *'«Chekov bottle»: If something is described in a previous chapter, it means it will be important for the action in a future chapter.'*

> *'Pay attention to negative cues: what should have happened but did not.'*

> *'Look for something that doesn't make sense. That's where the gold mine is:  
«It doesn't make sense, the price is going down!». The world makes sense, just not the model. Some X factor is hidden.'  
'Don't try to make sense of the world. It's too complicated. Instead watch investors attempting to make sense of it. They're the ones that will make the assets price move.'  
'look for the obvious: «Do you want to be a writer? You should have something to say.»'  
'The most important question: «What do you need to see to change your view?»' -- Adam Robinson (paraphrased)*

<!--
The key concept of emergence that is at play here is that components of a system self-organize to produce a state of affairs that is neither obvious nor predictable if you focus on the capabilities of the components themselves.

Your ability to think clearly determines the decisions you make and the actions you take.

The very act of stopping to think before you say or do anything almost always improves the quality of your ultimate response.

Ask yourself “does this decision require fast or slow thinking?” 

Create a hypothesis-- a yet-to-be-proven theory. Then seek ways to invalidate this hypothesis, to prove that your idea is wrong. This is what scientists do.

This is exactly the opposite of what most people do. They come up with an idea, and then they seek corroboration and proof that their idea is a good one. They practice “confirmation bias.” They only look for confirmation of the validity of the idea, and they simultaneously reject all input or information that is inconsistent with what they have already decided to believe.

Create a negative or reverse hypothesis. This is the opposite of your initial theory. For example, you are Isaac Newton, and the idea of gravity has just occurred to you. Your initial hypothesis would be that “things fall down.” You then attempt to prove the opposite—“things fall up.”

If you cannot prove the reverse or negative hypothesis of your idea, you can then conclude that your hypothesis is correct.

The first time it breaks, you blame the manufacturer. The second time, and every time after that, you blame the repair shop. For a repair shop, servicing appliances from a bad vendor can damage your reputation.
Since then, every time I make an appliance purchase – vacuum cleaner, dishwasher, car – I go to a repair shop. They’re always excited to talk to someone who will listen. They may even have a used model that will last you for years.

“I never allow myself to have an opinion on anything that I don't know the other side's argument better than they do.” -- Charlie Munger

My first thought,” William Deresiewicz said in one of my favorite speeches, “is never my best thought. My first thought is always someone else’s; it’s always what I’ve already heard about the subject, always the conventional wisdom.”

Knowing what you want is not enough, you must have a very clear blueprint for the specific actions you are going to take in order to achieve your end game

best way to del awith confirmation bias: You need to search out disconfirming evidence.

> *'A map is not the territory it represents, but, if correct, it has a similar structure to the territory, which accounts for its usefulness.' -- Alfred Korzybski, Science and Sanity*

confirmaton bias, the mother of all bias
In truth, we all believe in things we can’t prove.
If you’re intelligent, well-educated, and good at pulling facts, you’re going to be even better at confirming your own beliefs than someone who’s less intelligent or well-educated.
Our brains are wired so that we make better lawyers than we do scientists, in that a lawyer will look for and use evidence to support their client, while ignoring and definitely not using evidence that does the opposite.
We only want to watch television shows or read articles or listen to podcasts that confirm what we already believe -- what we already think we know.

Here’s an example of the confirmation bias: if you tell someone the person they’re about to meet is extroverted, they’re more likely to describe them as extroverted. If you tell someone the person they’re about to meet is introverted, they’re more likely to describe them as introverted.

If an animal hears a rustle in the grass, it might be a predator. Of course, it might just as easily be the wind, or a smaller animal, or it might be nothing at all. But if it is a predator, that would be dangerous. The end of the animal’s life, probably. They would be removed from the gene pool forever. So it’s much better -- in evolutionary terms -- to assume that all these rustles in the grass are predators, because the cost of not assuming it’s a predator is too high.

You might be thinking, “But why can’t this animal collect more data about these rustles in the grass? Why couldn’t it have evolved the capacity to do a more rational analysis?” Well, because that would take more time, and a predator doesn’t wait around for its prey to make a decision. Assuming is what keeps an animal alive, and therefore gives it more of a chance to reproduce -- and so it’s the animals that developed the ability to assume and make decisions rapidly that were more effective at reproducing.

This is why research in rapid cognition says that we -- that is, humans -- make our decisions intuitively most of the time.

It’s like buying a house. You make a list of all the things you want, and then usually it comes to down a feeling. “I don’t know why, but I just like this one.”

> *'What the human being is best at doing is interpreting all new information so that their prior conclusions remain intact.' -- Warren Buffett*

Confirmation bias is our tendency to cherry pick information which confirms pre-existing beliefs or ideas.
Two people with opposing views on a topic can see the same evidence, and still come away both validated by it
We can be cautious of data which seems to immediately support our views.The desire to be right is the thirst for truth.
Evaluating evidence (especially when it is complicated or unclear) requires a great deal of mental energy. Our brains prefer to take shortcuts.
This saves the time needed to make decisions, in particular when under pressure.

Accepting information which confirms our beliefs is easy and requires little mental energy. Yet contradicting information causes us to shy away, grasping for a reason to discard it.

Lewis Carroll stated “we are what we believe we are”, but it seems that the world is also what we believe it to be

The most difficult subjects can be explained to the most slow-witted man if he has not formed any idea of them already; but the simplest thing cannot be made clear to the most intelligent man if he is firmly persuaded that he knows already, without a shadow of doubt, what is laid before him.

Much of this is the result of our need for cognitive consistency. 

As a consequence, we tend to see more evidence which enforces our worldview. Confirmatory data is taken seriously, while disconfirmatory data is treated with scepticism. To constantly evaluate our worldview would be exhausting, so we prefer to strengthen it. 

confirmation bias: As music unfolds, the brain constantly updates its estimates of when new beats will occur, and takes satisfaction in matching a mental beat with a real-in-the-world one.

“The eye sees only what the mind is prepared to comprehend.” -- Robertson Davies

You need to search out disconfirming evidence.

As Rebecca Goldstein wrote in Incompleteness: The Proof and Paradox of Kurt Godel:

All truths -- even those that had seemed so certain as to be immune to the very possibility of revision -- are essentially manufactured. Indeed, the very notion of the objectively true is a socially constructed myth. Our knowing minds are not embedded in truth. Rather, the entire notion of truth is embedded in our minds, which are themselves the unwitting lackeys of organizational forms of influence.

Truth in stereotypes there'es truth on GROUP opinions.
steryotypes are the falsy _group_ opinions that account for a small amout.

### On planning and decision making

Plan ahead and prepare for the highly probable scenarios.  
Make the decisions right now. When in the moment of making the decision, you have already done it.

All models are wrong, some are useful. -- George Box
Remember that all models are wrong; the practical question is how wrong do they have to be to not be useful.

A model is a simplification which fosters understanding.
the wrong way to understand models: Too literally

“Scientists generally agree that no theory is 100 percent correct. Thus, the real test of knowledge is not truth, but utility. Science gives us power. The more useful that power, the better the science.” -- Yuval Noah Harari

“The basic trouble, you see, is that people think that “right” and “wrong” are absolute; that everything that isn't perfectly and completely right is totally and equally wrong.” -- Isaac Asimov

Take a look at almost any comment section on the internet and you are guaranteed to find at least one pedant raging about a minor perceived inaccuracy, throwing out the good with the bad

Occam’s razor states that the simplest solution is usually correct

“The world doesn’t have the luxury of waiting for complete answers before it takes action. — Daniel Gilber

Think of mental models as minimum viable products.
Sure, all of them can be improved. But the only way that can happen is if we try them out, educate ourselves and collectively refine them.

Your kitchen knives are not as sharp as they could be. Does that matter as long as they still cut vegetables? Your bed is not as comfortable as it could be. Does that matter if you can still get a good night’s sleep in it? Your internet is not as fast as it could be. Does that matter as long as you can load this article? Arguably not. Our world runs on the functional, not the perfect. This is what a mental model is – a functional tool. A tool which maybe could be a bit sharper or easier to use, but still does the job.

Georg Rasch said the following:
When you construct a model you leave out all the details which you, with the knowledge at your disposal, consider inessential…. Models should not be true, but it is important that they are applicable, and whether they are applicable for any given purpose must, of course, be investigated. This also means that a model is never accepted finally, only on trial.

As we know, the map is not the territory. A map can be seen as a symbol or index of a place, not an icon.

“A map is not the territory it represents, but, if correct, it has a similar structure to the territory, which accounts for its usefulness.” -- Alfred Korzybski

mapa mental!

Physical maps generally become more accurate as time passes. Not long ago, they often included countries which didn’t exist, omitted some which did, portrayed the world as flat or fudged distances. Nowadays, our maps have come a long way.

The same goes for mental models – they are always evolving, being revised – never really achieving perfection. Certainly, over time, the best models are revised only slightly, but we must never consider our knowledge “set”.

“A model which took account of all the variation of reality would be of no more use than a map at the scale of one to one.” -- Joan Robinson

Too many people are caught up wasting time on physics-like precision in areas of practical life that do not have such precision available. A better approach is to ask “Is it useful?” and, if yes, “To what extent?”

Mental models are a way of thinking about the world that prepares us to make good decisions in the first place.

The critical point for any innovation is the transition from the early adapters to the sceptics, for at this point there is a ‘chasm'.

When enough people (a critical mass) think about and truly consider the plausibility of a concept, it becomes reality.” -- Joseph Duda

His hypothesis was that white families had different levels of tolerance for the number of people of racial minorities in their neighborhoods. Some white families were completely racist; others were not concerned with the race of their neighbors. As increasing numbers of racial minorities moved into neighborhoods, the most racist people would soon leave. Then a tipping point would occur — a critical mass of white people would leave until the area was populated by racial minorities. This phenomenon became known as “white flight

Critical Mass in Psychology
Psychologists have known for a long time that groups of people behave differently than individuals.
Sometimes when we are in a group, we tend to be less inhibited, more rebellious, and more confident. This effect is known as mob behaviour. (An interesting detail is that mob psychology is one of the few branches of psychology which does not concern individuals.) As a general rule, the larger the crowd, the less responsibility people have for their behaviour. (This is also why individuals and not groups should make decisions.)

In Zero to One, Peter Thiel describes how PayPal achieved the critical mass of users needed for it to be useful:
For PayPal to work, we needed to attract a critical mass of at least a million users. Advertising was too ineffective to justify the cost. Prospective deals with big banks kept falling through. So we decided to pay people to sign up.
We gave new customers $10 for joining, and we gave them $10 more every time they referred a friend. This got us hundreds of thousands of new customers and an exponential growth rate.

The Problems With Goals:
-Goals have an enndpoint
-Goals rely on factors which we do not always have control over.
-Goals rely on willpower and self-discipline.
-Keeping a goal in mind and using it to direct our actions requires constant willpower.
-Goals can make us complacent or reckless.

even the best and most useful maps suffer from limitations, and Korzybski gives us a few to explore: (A.) The map could be incorrect without us realizing it; (B.) The map is, by necessity, a reduction of the actual thing, a process in which you lose certain important information; and (C.) A map needs interpretation, a process that can cause major errors. (The only way to truly solve the last would be an endless chain of maps-of-maps, which he called self-reflexiveness.)

charlie munger:

Wisdom and Circle of Competence
“Knowing what you don’t know is more useful than being brilliant.”
“Acknowledging what you don’t know is the dawning of wisdom.”
“People are trying to be smart—all I am trying to do is not to be idiotic, but it’s harder than most people think.”
“It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent.”

“At Berkshire there has never been a master plan. Anyone who wanted to do it, we fired because it takes on a life of its own and doesn’t cover new reality. We want people taking into account new information.”

“Know the big ideas in the big disciplines and use them routinely-- all of them, not just a few.”

you don't win by predicting the future; you win by getting the odds right. You can be right about the future and still not make any money. At the racetrack, for example, the favorite horse may be the one most likely to win, but since everyone wants to bet on the favorite, how likely is it that betting on the favorite will make you money? The horse to bet on is the one more likely to win than most people expect. That's the one that gives you the best odds. That's the bet that pays off over time. -- will bonner

The ability to destroy your ideas rapidly instead of slowly when the occasion is right is one of the most valuable things.

As Rabbi Moses ben Maimon (1135-1204), commonly known as Maimonides, said: “Teach thy tongue to say I do not know, and thou shalt progress.”
Great thinkers, like Darwin, did the work necessary to hold an opinion. And it's one of the biggest reasons he's buried at Westminster Abbey. Doing the work counteracts our natural desire seek out only information that confirms what we believe we know.

Most of the time people don't put us to the test. When they do, the results don't match our confidence.

If you want to win an argument, ask the person trying to convince you of something to explain how it would work.
Odds are they have not done the work required to hold an opinion. If they can explain why they are correct and how things would work, you'll learn something. If they can't you'll soften their views, perhaps nudging them ever so softly toward your views.

Always assume that you’re wrong from a purely philosophical point of view. We are always wrong about whatever we believe. Knowledge is always moving forward, and if you think about things you used to believe 10 years ago or five years ago, it embarrasses you now. And the things that you hold dear and hold to be true today are likely going to embarrass you in 10 or 20 years from now. 

Say no to things you aren’t really excited about doing. Hell yes or no. The mediocre robs you of the great. sivers

Clarity is the Key to All Success: without a clear roadmap for who we are and what we want to achieve, we will never find true success.
You must know exactly what you want, when you want it, and why you want it.

### On starting and timing

Just start.  
Stop making resolutions and start making something.

Why people procrastinate?

1. lack of urgency / deadlines (the panic monster)
No inspiration or opportunities - the inspiration you are waiting for, in order to start, is on the other side of starting. Momentum generates motivation.

Time is the most precious thing you own.

– Have a Mission
Every day, whether it’s “be creative today.” Or “go some place you’ve never been” or “talk to ten random strangers”, make a mission.
Learn something new.
Missions are for people who DO. Mission statements are for people who DON’T.

1. Don’t overthink it. Don’t waste time analyzing it.

> *'Do not wait to strike till the iron is hot; but make it hot by striking.' -- Yeats*

Timing is important.

> *'Enter action with boldness.'*

'Master the art of timing' -- Robert Greene (28th and 35th law of power)*

However don't wait for the [perfect occasion](), a good occasion is a safer bet.  
You will languish if you stop for a long time. Paralysis is worse than bad timing.

> *'The world doesn’t have the luxury of waiting for complete answers before it takes action.' -- Daniel Gilber*

> *'Did you know you can't steer a boat that isn't moving? Just like a life.' -- Paul Lutus*

HOWEVER, have a [plan](#on-planning). Any plan will do it.

> *'No one ever wrote a plan to be fat lazy or stupid. That’s what happens when you don’t have a plan.' – Larry Winget*

Direction is more important than pace.

> *'Speed is useful only if you are running in the right direction.' -- Joel Barker*

> *'Moving in a direction opposite to what we are doing right now where we are not successful will guarantee success.'*

> *'When you run, make sure you run to something and not away from.' -- The Avett Brothers*

Don’t be afraid to take time away to find it. 

> *'Only fools rush into a situation. By committing too quickly you lose your maneuverability.'*

Don't be thirsty.

<!--
Focus just on 3 outcomes per day.
Focus on doing the right things instead of doing things right.
Set specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and time-based goals.
View actions towards a goal not in terms of progress, but of commitment to the goal.
Set process goals (which help you achieve a larger goal).
Work with a purpose in mind.

you're not perfect in everything. find your specialty.

When everything is a priority nothing is a priority. Attempting to maximize competing variables is a recipe for disaster. Picking one variable, and relentlessly focusing on it, which is an effective strategy, diverges from the norm. It's hard to compete with businesses who have correctly identified the right variables to maximize or minimize. - munger

4. Focus on Revenue Generating Activities
One of the simplest habits that you can start implementing today is to shift all of your focus towards revenue generating activities.
Plain and simple, if it is not going to earn you money, then don’t do it. Focus only on the activities that are going to push the envelope forward for you and your company and result in an influx of cash.
If there are tasks that need to be done that do not directly result in the generation of revenue, then outsource them so that you have more time to work on building your cash flow.

try to hit 10% of your followers instead of trying to hit all of them at the same time.

if you are the focus you will be assumed as being the the cause.

And too many decisions will drain you. Attention is the most limited resource.

make the basics in life, and you're good to go. you don't need to optimise.

1. Learn to Focus on What You Are Doing Now- be fully present
The more present and focused you can be in one area, the more focus and presence you will be able to bring to the other areas of your life.

### On balance

Life is a balancing act.

The dose makes the poison: things in excess become their opposite.  
The hardest skill is knowing when to stop.

> *'Do not go past the mark you aimed for; in victory, learn when to stop.' -- Robert Greene (47th law of power)*

> *'The hardest skill is knowing what could be simplified, and what's good enough.'*

> *'Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.'*

> *'If half of the room laughs and half doesn't is a success.'*

> *'A balance sheet must balance.'*

> *'Most things are not binary.'*

> *'Balance is not about spending the same amount of time focused on every area of your life either. It's about making progress in all areas of your life and ensuring that you improve just a little bit each day in your health, wealth, relationships, and personal growth.'*

Diversification solves a lot of problems.

> *'Don’t try to make your job your whole life. Don’t try to make your art your sole income.'*

How to balance an imbalance? Overcompensate.

> *'Overcompensate to make it balanced.' -- Derek Sivers*

> *'Some people get passion from something they struggled with.'*

<!--

if not this not leads to happiness, it leads to achievement.
work/life balance.
you have the option to work 24/7, with the 9to5 the option was made to you, now is more difficult and you need to draw a line.
most of us don't want to draw the line and they suffer the consequences.

self improvement as a limit: 20% will give 80% of results.

MM
There are two approaches to improving yourself:
1) The self-improvement junkie. 
2) The self-improvement tourists.
I would argue that self-help tourists are using self-improvement advice in a healthy manner and that self-help junkies are (often, but not always) using it in an unhealthy manner. Remember, the paradoxical point of all self-improvement is to reach a point where you no longer feel you need to improve yourself. Therefore, the constant indulgence in self-improvement material just continues to feed that feeling of inadequacy.

fomo -> fear of missing out

Where does it end? It doesn’t. At least not until you decide it does.
Because the only way to truly benefit from self-improvement is to one day arrive at a place where you no longer need it. Like a cast for a broken arm. Or a bandage for a deep cut. You put it on, let it heal you. And then you take it off and move on with your life.

The 80/20 Principle states that 80% of the output or results will come from 20% of the input or action.

“Growth for growth’s sake is the ideology of the cancer cell.” -- Edward Abbey

Enough is the opposite of hunger. The counter to paranoia. The antidote to anxiety.

Exponential growth devours and corrupts
There is no higher God in Silicon Valley than growth. No sacrifice too big for its craving altar. As long as you keep your curve exponential, all your sins will be forgotten at the exit.

### On adapting

Plans are not static. Adapt not react.  
You need to switch strategies a few times to get where you want to go.

> *'I am a man of fixed and unbending principles, the first of which is to be flexible at all times.' -- Everett Dirksen*

> *'Life is more like tetris than chess.'*

> *'One should not be too straightforward. Go & see the forest. The straight trees are cut down, the crooked ones are left standing.' -- Kautilya*

> *'The most important thing to do if you find yourself in a hole is to stop digging.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'What got you here won't get you there.'*

> *'The directions to get you anywhere include a few turns:  
Sometimes you need to say YES to everything and be open to growth;  
Sometimes you need to say NO to everything and focus.  
It's scary to make those direction choices, but that's how I know I'm on to something. Fear is a great road sign.'  
-- Derek Sivers (paraphrased)*

> *'When the winds of change blow, some people build walls while others build windmills.' -- Chinese proverb*

> *'However beautiful the strategy, you should occasionally look at the results.' -- Winston Churchill*

> *'Whatever space and time mean, place and occasion mean more.' -- Aldo van Eyck*

> *'If I don’t have red, I use blue.' -- Pablo Picasso*

HINT: Willpower is finite. So there are limits on change. Change requires attention.

HOWEVER...

> *'Preach the need for change, but never reform too much at once.' -- Robert Greene (45th law of power)*

<!--


stick to the plan. poople sabotage their one plans when it get tedious, nobnotusos, challegnig or too difficult. people think they need a new plan.

Be flexible. You need to be able to be a diplomate and a fighter, to speak well among the scholars of academia and the blue collar workers down at the bar.
You need to be comfortable both in a suit and tie and in camouflaged jacket.

Go With the Flow of Change
One of the biggest mistakes that you can make in any endeavor is to stick to rigidly to the old axioms and ways of thinking.
As Bruce Lee said “Be like water”, be willing to change and adapt to the world around you.

# 3.3 - On competing

### On creating imbalances

Create imbalances in your target to create an advantage and raise chances of winning.  
Use methods like [unpredictability](#on-unpredictability), [deceiving](#on-deceiving), [mirroring](#on-mirroring)
and [bait](#on-charming). Some opponents may require special tools.

> *'Keeping your enemies on the defensive and in react mode will have a demoralizing effect on them.'*

> *'If you control the overall direction and framing of the battle, anything they do will play into your hands.'*

HOWEVER... beware of counter-attacking.

> *'The problems created by an audacious move can be disguised, even remedied, by more and greater audacity.'*

> *'Whenever you find yourself on the defensive and in trouble, the greatest danger is the impulse to overreact.'*

<!-- 
> *'Moving first—initiating the attack—will often put you at a disadvantage: you are exposing your strategy and limiting your options.'*

Divide and conquer it.

1. You need to recognize when you're not learning, for one thing. If it's easy, you're not learning. You need to push yourself into the zone of discomfort, where you feel clumsy and have a hard time. Now you're learning.
2. Find a mentor. Lacking that, find e.g. talk of someone explaining some hard techniques and then try to follow the advice. Even and especially if it feels clumsy at first.
3. Switch to a new job where you'll be exposed to new things. try to find a job where people do code review, feedback is how we learn faster.
4. Learn how to learn: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKTxC9pl-WM
5. Reflect on your mistakes, try to find what cues you missed and what you should look for next time. I've been doing this on weekly basis (you can read the results at https://softwareclown.com) and I've learned a huge amount from figuring out underlying cause of what I did wrong.

The metagame is playing a different game than your competitors. A game they can't play.
The metagame is this psychological game that exists among players, involving adjustments – adjustments based on how an opponent is likely to interpret a given set of actions. Better players adjust their strategies and styles to those of particular opponents, always analyzing how the opponents are playing in terms of how the opponents believe they're playing.
Maintaining a well-balanced strategy, while deciphering your opponents' strategies, is the key to the metagame. If you comprehend the concept of the metagame, accurately perceive the flow of your table and then tournament, and stay alerted to and aware of current strategy trends, you'll be able to successfully mix up your play when considering your image and that of your opponents. In return, your game will be highly unpredictable and difficult to read, which should be your ultimate goal.
Part of their greatness comes from identifying the constraints of others and capitalizing on those structural disadvantages.
In any system where there are norms, there are strengths and weaknesses to those norms. If you follow the norms of the system, the results you get are likely to be the norm. When you play a different game, a metagame, you have the opportunity to outperform.

### On charming

Charm the enemy and find their weaknesses. Then [exploit them](#on-deceiving).

> *'Instead of killing, charm the snake (once there are always more snakes) to fight the other ones. Listen actively and maintain rapport. Know your audience. First they have to [trust](#on-trust) you. Keep your word and prove your worth, the new guy as always to prove himself.'*

> *'Use selective honesty and generosity to disarm your victim.'  
'Pose as a friend, work as a spy.'  
'Discover each man’s thumbscrew.'  
'Work on the hearts and minds of others.' -- Robert Greene (12th, 14th, 33rd and 43rd law of power)*

> *'People's need for validation and recognition, their need to feel important, is the best kind of weakness to exploit.'*

> *'If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his own language, that goes to his heart.' -- Nelson Mandela*

> *'When you go up in an hierarchy, the need of persuasion is higher.  
To persuade up, focus in interests; to persuade down focus in emotions.'*

Use absence and bait to attract people.

> *'In the long run, the ability to make others come to you is a weapon far more powerful than any tool of aggression.'*

> *'Make other people come to you: use bait if necessary.'  
'Learn to keep people dependent on you.' -- Robert Greene (8th and 11th law of power)*

> *'Bait people into going out on a limb, exposing their weaknesses, then rake them with fire from the side.'*

> *'We attract more flies with honey than vinegar.'*

> *'Stay aloof and people will come to you. It will become a challenge for them to win your affections.'*

> *'Use absence to increase respect and honor.' -- Robert Greene (16th law of power)*

HOWEVER... use absence with [moderation](#on-balance).

> *'If you're always absent, soon you'll not be needed.'*

### On deceiving

'Appear weak when you are strong and strong when you are weak.' -- Sun Tzu

> *'Court attention at all cost.'  
'Play to people’s fantasies.'  
'Create compelling spectacles.'  
'Stir up waters to catch fish.' -- Robert Greene (6th, 32nd, 37th and 39th law of power)*

> *'Play a sucker to catch a sucker - seem dumber than your mark.' -- Robert Greene (21st law of power)*

> *'By seeming stronger than you are, perhaps through an occasional act that is reckless and bold, you can deter the enemy from attacking you.'*

> *'Honesty is a very expensive gift, don't expect it from cheap people.' -- Warren Buffett*

HOWEVER... deceiving is not lying.

> *'Lying is like a nuclear bomb. The effects will be there for a long time to you to deal with.'*

> *'One of the most potent weapons in the battle for information is giving out false information.'*

> *'Don't lie to anybody that you are not going to kill. Lying is a bad idea. The lie is going to burn you.' -- hostage negotiator*

> *'I'm not upset that you lied to me. I'm upset that from now on I can't believe on you.' -- Nietzsche*

### On unpredictability

> *'Conceal your intention.'  
'Say less than necessary.'  
'Keep others in suspended terror: cultivate an air of unpredictability.'  
'Assume formlessness.' -- Robert Greene (3rd, 4th, 17th and 48th law of power)*

HOWEVER... unpredictability can work against you: if you are in a subordinate position, it reduces trust.



---
### On mirroring

Mirroring works best when your group is in minority.

> *'Being pacifist in face of wolves is the source of endless tragedy.'*

> *'To change a status quo based on a minority, the majority must unite. To do that use non-violent organized action and humor, keeping the risk as low as possible so everybody can join your side.' -- Srdja Popovic*

> *'Disarm and infuriate with the mirror effect.' -- Robert Greene (44th law of power)*



---
### On opponents

1) Beware of easy opponents. Most times it's [bait](#on-charming).

> *'Despise the free lunch.' -- Robert Greene (40th law of power)*

> *'Sometimes one pays most for the things one gets for nothing.' -- Albert Einstein*

> *«El dorados» are never drawn in the map.'*

And desperate opponents will risk anything in a fight. This gives them a huge advantage, they have nothing to lose.

> *'Beware the fury of a patient man.' -- John Dryden*

> *'Use anger only as a tool, when you need it to improve your situation.'*

> *'Beware of sad people.'*

> *'Our fearlessness shall be our secret weapon.' -- John Green* 

HOWEVER... there are same people acting stupid. Easy wins if you can identify them.

> *'Don't attribute to malice what you can attribute to incompetence or busyness.'*

> *'In the course of your life you will be continually encountering fools. There are simply too many to avoid.'*

> *'Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the the universe.' -- Albert Einstein*

2) On difficult opponents, to win, besides outworking them, you'll need all weaponry.

> *'Put all the meat in the barbecue.' -- Portuguese soccer coach*

Even the «dirty stuff»: «pawn sacrifices», bribes and lying are examples of «dirty stuff».  
They can be effective but use them *only* on life changing situations: it's a scar for life.

> *'Get others to do the work for you, but always take the credit.'  
'Keep your hands clean.' -- Robert Greene (7th and 26th law of power)*

When nothing else works, [surrender](#on-surrendering). Only use anger and go [all in](#on-desperate-opponents) if you can see the end already.



---
### On defeating status quo

The only successful changes are those coming from within.

> *'To successfully change a status quo maintained by a minority you only need to unite the majority. How?  
Make a non-violent revolution: low risk will make more people to participate.' -- Srdja Popovic*

Finish it. [Going halfway](#on-focus) is too expensive to do it often.

> *'Don't take a half step where a full step is required.'*

> *'Crush your enemy totally.' -- Robert Greene (15th law of power)*

> *'Ultimately the only peace and security you can hope for from your enemies is their disappearance.'*

### On surrendering

Use this opportunity to re-create yourself.  
'It only hurts when you don't have time to prepare for the fall' -- Tony Hawk

> *'Surrender conceals great power: lulling the enemy into complacency, it give you time to recoup, time to undermine, time for revenge.'*

> *'Use the surrender tactic: transform weakness into power.'  
'Re-create yourself.' -- Robert Greene (22nd and 25th law of power)*

### On winning

It's not just about winning. The way you win sets you up for the next round.

> *'Win through your actions, never through argument.'  
'Make your accomplishments seem effortless.' -- Robert Greene (9th and 30th law of power)*

> *'You only find out who is swimming naked when the tide goes out.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'All endings are also beginnings. We just don’t know it at the time.' --  Mitch Albom*

> *'The destination is not the end of the road; it's just a stop along the way. An intersection to take you to your next destination.'*

> *'Winning isn’t everything, but wanting to win is.' -- Vince Lombardi*

<!--
tecnically win or fundamentally win

winning by exhaustion
Traditional military theorists such as Sun Tzu (“Supreme excellence consists of breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting”) and Machiavelli (“Never attempt to win by force what can be won by deception”) evangelized for clever tactics. These methods tend to result in far fewer casualties, waste fewer resources and are a display of superior intellect, rather than just strength.

Attrition warfare is usually a last resort only. And most of the time when you win, it's only temporary. By not scoring a decisive blow, the winners leave room for the losers to believe they can win the next time.

“The war will be ended by the exhaustion of nations rather than the victories of armies.” -- Winston Churchill

From the start, the Battle of Verdun was fought upon a foundation of attrition. Both sides were essentially trapped, with no option but to keep trying to force the other into submission. Both sides were using similar approaches with similar capabilities.

The concept of attrition applies outside of war. Bureaucracies grind people out. Excessive competition among businesses might be good for consumers, but it's a grind for the companies involved.

History shows that the way out of trench warfare is the use of asymmetric weaponry. If you're using basically the same strategy with basically the same resources as your competitor, you're in a war of attrition.
