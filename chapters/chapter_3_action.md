# 3.1 - On preparing action

### On creativity, vision and ideas

Always be doing something creative. Without new experiences, your soul rots.

Finding a good idea: idea sex - mix stuff

> *'Good ideas are a numbers game. You need a lot of bad ones to get one good.'*

> *'We can’t solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them.'*

> *'The new is the forgotten because everything has already happened.' -- Arturo Pérez Reverte*

> *'We don’t have an «imagination» we have a memory.'*

> *'Those who do not want to imitate anything, produce nothing.' -- Salvador Dali*

> *'The secret to creativity is knowing how to hide your sources.' -- Albert Einstein*

> *'Good artists copy; great artists steal.' -- Steve Jobs & others*

> *'To invent, you need a good imagination and a pile of junk.' -- Thomas Edison*

> *'Creative minds are rarely tidy.'*

Judging ideas?

> *'Peers (fellow creators) are the best judging ideas. Managers are the worse because they are outcome attached (they will regret more a false positive than a false negative).'*

> *'Ideas by themselves are roughly worthless. There's no market for them. There's no place where one can go and buy an idea. Describing your idea in detail doesn't mean other people will copy it. First they'll have to be convinced it's a good idea. If you ever tried to change anyone else's mind you know by now how hard that is. Not even founders themselves can predict how well their own ideas will do. And even if people are convinced your idea is a good idea, they'll still have to compare it to the existing idea they are already working on and see which one they're more likely to do well with.'*

<!--
-ideas are not worth a damn thing. Only execution is.Forget all of your ideas. Instead, worry about transforming yourself into the kind of person who can execute and bring ideas to life.

negative inspiration (things that don't work) - positive inspiration!

> *'Moments of originality and moments of conformity.'*

> *'Teach no one your tricks or they will be used against you.'* 

ignorance is a bliss, gives you freedom to think about stuff. being ignorant about the market and the «right way» to do things allows them to come up with creative solutions to problems that experienced veterans would never have thought of. Do not see your ignorance as a curse, see it as a blessing.

Creativity is a muscle - you have to practice it every day.

> *'Far better an approximate answer to the right question, which is often vague, than an exact answer to the wrong question, which can always be made precise.' -- John Tukey*

Once creativity stays the same, it is no longer creative.

Amos Tversky, the late collaborator of Nobel-winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman, once said “the secret to doing good research is always to be a little underemployed. You waste years by not being able to waste hours.”

boredom leads to creativity

“If you accept conventional wisdom from conventional people living conventional lives. Can you expect to be anything other than conventional?”

I believe creativity is born out of free time
-->

Creativity is linked to autonomy.

> *'Creativity and critical thinking:<br>
In subordinate position it gets you labelled a dreamer, a weirdo, or an idiot.<br>
In executive position, visionary, maverick, multidisciplinary thinker, etc.<br>
You can only truly creative in a position with autonomy, so you either climb the ladder or start your own thing.'*

### On analysis

Analysis is an art, not a science.

> *'To find deep truths intuition is better than statistics.'*

> *'Statistics are like bikinis. What they reveal is suggestive, but what they conceal is vital.' -- Levenstein*

> *'«Dictator's dilemma»: when the vote goes 79% – 21% for some candidate we presume it was fair and represents a popular mandate. But when his excellency and Great Father of his People, gets 97% of the vote we say that is BS.'*

And, as such, error-prone:<br>
a) randomness;

> *'Most facts are a «tell» but some are just random.'*

> *'Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.' -- Sigmund Freud*

c) [being deceived](#on-deceiveness);

> *'Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts.'*

> *'Never assume that what people say or do in a particular moment is a statement of their permanent desires.'*

b) and specially, bias, will trigger miscalculations.

> *'What Susie says of Sally says mores about Susie than of Sally.'*

> *'Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth.'*

> *'The hardest thing to explain is the glaringly evident that everyone has decided not to see.' -- Ayn Rand*

> *'An unfamiliar city is a fine thing. That’s the time and place when you can suppose that all of the people you meet are nice.' -- Louis Céline*

> *'Each generation imagines itself to be more intelligent than the one that went before it, and wiser than the one that comes after it.' -- Orwell*

> *'Experiment and theory often show remarkable agreement when performed in the same laboratory' -- Daniel Bershader*

Be specially careful when facing new ideas.<br>
Too much info is also prone to bias: you'll always find confirmation to your pre-existing beliefs.

> *'Nothing is as simple at seems at first, or as hopeless as it seems in the middle, or as finished as it seems in the end.'*

> *'I am both worse and better than you thought.' -- Sylvia Plath*

> *'You always get exaggerated notions of things you don’t know anything about.' -- Albert Camus*

HINTS:

> *'«Chekov bottle»: If something is described in a previous chapter, it means it will be important for the action in a future chapter.'*

> *'Pay attention to negative cues: what should have happened but did not.'*

> *'Look for something that doesn't make sense. That's where the gold mine is:<br>
«It doesn't make sense, the price is going down!». The world makes sense, just not the model. Some X factor is hidden.'<br>
'Don't try to make sense of the world. It's too complicated. Instead watch investors attempting to make sense of it. They're the ones that will make the assets price move.'<br>
'look for the obvious: «Do you want to be a writer? You should have something to say.»'<br>
'The most important question: «What do you need to see to change your view?»' -- Adam Robinson (paraphrased)*

<!--
not playing your hand but playing your opponent.'*

Nietszche says to measure one's strength by the number of parasites one can support.

It is possible to view this as an isolated event or a trend

One of the great problems with filters is our human tendency to think that what we see is all there is, without realizing that what we see is being filtered.

“A world constructed from the familiar is the world in which there's nothing to learn.”
In shaping what we see, filter bubbles show us a distorted map and not the terrain

> *'Have you ever noticed that anybody driving slower than you is an idiot, and anyone going faster than you is a maniac?' -- George Carlin*

> *'Don't tell me what you value. Show me your budget, and I'll tell you what you value.' -- Joe Biden quoting his father*
-->

### On planning and decision making

Plan ahead and prepare for the highly probable scenarios.<br>
Make the decisions right now. When in the moment of making the decision, you have already done it.

> *'Plan all the way to the end.' -- Robert Greene (29th law of power)*

> *'All battles are won or lost before they are ever fought.' -- Sun Tzu*

> *'The best way to predict the future is to invent it.' -- Alan Kay*

> *'If I had 9 hours to chop down a tree, I'd spend the first six sharpening my ax.' -- Abraham Lincoln*

> *'The script is going to be bad but in the end we'll finish eating pizza.'*

> *'I am not a product of my circumstances. I am a product of my decisions.' -- Stephen Cove*

> *'You have choices. Choices are experiments.'*

> *'Decisions are made based on memory. There are 3 routes: reflex (genetics), habits or goals. Influence their memories and you can influence their decisions.'*

<!--
“Hard decisions are only hard when you’re in the process of making them.” -- Debbie Millman

D: Define the problem simply.
A: Assess the impact.
N: Name the underlying dynamic.
C: Create the smallest next step you can.
E: Establish personal accountability.


Do i need to justify my choice? What am i searching for? functional decision vs emotional decision.

too familiar - too unfamiliar. we like what is in the middle! similar enough and different enough to be liked. the secret is on the [middle](#on-balance)

Always assume that you’re wrong from a purely philosophical point of view. We are always wrong about whatever we believe. Knowledge is always moving forward, and if you think about things you used to believe 10 years ago or five years ago, it embarrasses you now. And the things that you hold dear and hold to be true today are likely going to embarrass you in 10 or 20 years from now. 

Say no to things you aren’t really excited about doing. Hell yes or no. The mediocre robs you of the great. sivers 

Make decisions about what you want to do ideally on the front end rather than tracking what you do on the back end. Planning a diet vs. recording a diet. Making decisions under stress vs making decisions when relaxed and clear headed.

we think we make choices but our choices are affected by others. (ex of naming a child)
people pick what is familiar. people are influenced without us realizing.
working class want to feel the same as others.
white collar want to feel different from others.

decisions are tainted by the emotional investments you accumulate, and the more you invest in something the harder it becomes to abandon it.

inoculate yourself from the stress of making hard decisions when you need to. -- Allen Tucker

Clarity is the Key to All Success: without a clear roadmap for who we are and what we want to achieve, we will never find true success.
You must know exactly what you want, when you want it, and why you want it.
Without this clarity, you will find yourself wandering aimlessly for years, or even decades of your life and looking back, wishing that you’d had more direction.

-->

How to plan: start with a [vision](#on-creativity-vision-and-ideas).

> *'Vision is the art of seeing what is invisible to others.' -- Johnathan Swift*

> *'Someone’s sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'If you don’t know where you’re going, any road will get you there.' -- Lewis Carroll*

> *'Strategy requires thought; tactics require observation.' -- Max Euwe*

HINTS: How to plan?

> *'Look for actionable steps.'*

> *'A well defined problem seeks its own solution' -- Mike Brundant*

HINTS: How to decide?

> *'May your choices reflect your choices, not your fears.' -- Nelson Mandela*

> *'Choose the plan with more options. The one that lets you change plan.'*

> *'Hell yes or no.' -- Derek Sivers*

HOWEVER... some people get paralyzed by [over thinking](#on-starting-and-timing).

> *'Don’t think too much, you’ll create a problem that wasn’t there in the first place.'*

> *'While we are reasoning concerning life, life is gone.' -- David Hume*

<!--
Decide in advance what your time is worth. Do not let others tell you how much you will be paid. They may make offers, but it is never their decision. It is yours.

understand the problem (what is the priority) -> visualize a solution, come out with a plan -> overcomunicate -> adapt to win (the enemy has always a vote

# 3.2 - On executing

### On starting, right time and procrastination

Just start.<br>
You cannot afford to wait for inspiration or opportunities, time is the most precious thing you own.<br>
Stop preparing and start doing. You can learn while you do it.

<!--
fear of starting, excuse

> *add mark manson on procrastination*
> *'Pressed by circumstances, we feel unusually energized and focused.'*

– Have a Mission
Every day, whether it’s “be creative today.” Or “go some place you’ve never been” or “talk to ten random strangers”, make a mission.
Learn something new.
Missions are for people who DO. Mission statements are for people who DON’T.

You will languish if you stop for a long time.

> *'Master the art of timing.' -- Robert Greene (35th law of power)*

> *'Did you know you can't steer a boat that isn't moving? Just like a life.' -- Paul Lutus*

HOWEVER... you should have a [plan](#on-planning).

> *'If you are unsure of a course of action, do not attempt it. Your doubts and hesitations will infect your execution.'*

> *'Once you step into a fight that is not of your own choosing, you lose all initiative.'*

### On pace, position and direction

Direction is more important than pace.<br>
Don’t be afraid to take time away to find it. 

> *'Speed is useful only if you are running in the right direction.' -- Joel Barker*

> *'Moving in a direction opposite to what we are doing right now where we are not successful will guarantee success.'*

> *'When you run, make sure you run to something and not away from.' -- The Avett Brothers*

> *'Only fools rush into a situation. By committing too quickly you lose your maneuverability.'*

> *'No matter how great the talent or efforts, some things just take time. You can’t produce a baby in one month by getting nine women pregnant.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'You finished ahead of time, that means you forgot something.'*

Don't be thirsty.

Time itself, is not your limitation. Attention is.<br>
You’re not managing time, you're managing attention.

> *'Do things in batch all at once. Interruption and switching between tasks costs too much.'*

> *'Any media company harvest your attention and transform it into revenue.'*

> *'Busy imply out of control. lack of time is lack of priorities.'*

First the essential. Then the details.

> *'Concentrate your forces.'<br>
'Strike the shepherd and the sheep will scatter.' -- Robert Greene (23rd and 42nd law of power)*

> *'In a divided world, power will come from keeping your own group united and cohesive.'*

Focus on the one thing most likely to get maximum results. Forget everything else.'*

> *'Reduce decision making on small tasks to a minimum and do it quickly and in bulk: what to wear, what to eat, etc.'*

> *'Don't major on minor things.'*

HOWEVER...

4. Focus on Revenue Generating Activities
One of the simplest habits that you can start implementing today is to shift all of your focus towards revenue generating activities.
Plain and simple, if it is not going to earn you money, then don’t do it. Focus only on the activities that are going to push the envelope forward for you and your company and result in an influx of cash.
If there are tasks that need to be done that do not directly result in the generation of revenue, then outsource them so that you have more time to work on building your cash flow.

try to hit 10% of your followers instead of trying to hit all of them at the same time.

if you are the focus you will be assumed as being the the cause.

And too many decisions will drain you. Attention is the most limited resource.

make the basics in life, and you're good to go. you don't need to optimise.

1. Learn to Focus on What You Are Doing Now- be fully present
The more present and focused you can be in one area, the more focus and presence you will be able to bring to the other areas of your life.
-->



---
### On control

Control what you can. Ignore what you can't.

> *'You can lead a horse to water but you can’t make him drink.'*

> *'You can only control yourself. Control what you’re primed by, who you are around, the ideas and problems you focus on. Power comes from that. '*

> *'You want everything to stay the same until you’re ready for it to change. But you can’t do that. You can’t expect the whole world to stand still until you’re ready.' -- Gayle Friesen*

> *'Disdain things you cannot have: ignoring them is the best revenge.' -- Robert Greene (36th law of power)*

> *'If you change the way you look at things, the thing you look at change' -- Dr. Wayne Dyer*

HOWEVER...

> *'If things seem under control, you're just not going fast enough.' -- Mario Andretti*

> *'One’s real life is often the life that one does not lead.' -- Oscar Wilde*



---
### On balance

Life is a balancing act.

The dose makes the poison: things in excess become their opposite.<br>
The hardest skill is knowing when to stop.

> *'Do not go past the mark you aimed for; in victory, learn when to stop.' -- Robert Greene (47th law of power)*

> *'The hardest skill is knowing what could be simplified, and what's good enough.'*

> *'Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.'*

> *'If half of the room laughs and half doesn't is a success.'*

> *'A balance sheet must balance.'*

> *'Most things are not binary.'*

> *'Balance is not about spending the same amount of time focused on every area of your life either. It's about making progress in all areas of your life and ensuring that you improve just a little bit each day in your health, wealth, relationships, and personal growth.'*

Diversification solves a lot of problems.

> *'Don’t try to make your job your whole life. Don’t try to make your art your sole income.'*

How to balance an imbalance? Overcompensate.

> *'Overcompensate to make it balanced.' -- Derek Sivers*

> *'Some people get passion from something they struggled with.'*



---
### On adapting

Plans are not static. Adapt or die.<br>
You need to switch strategies a few times to get where you want to go.

> *'I am a man of fixed and unbending principles, the first of which is to be flexible at all times.' -- Everett Dirksen*

> *'Life is more like tetris than chess.'*

> *'One should not be too straightforward. Go & see the forest. The straight trees are cut down, the crooked ones are left standing.' -- Kautilya*

> *'The most important thing to do if you find yourself in a hole is to stop digging.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'What got you here won't get you there.'*

> *'The directions to get you anywhere include a few turns:<br>
Sometimes you need to say YES to everything and be open to growth;<br>
Sometimes you need to say NO to everything and focus.<br>
It's scary to make those direction choices, but that's how I know I'm on to something. Fear is a great road sign.'<br>
-- Derek Sivers (paraphrased)*

> *'However beautiful the strategy, you should occasionally look at the results.' -- Winston Churchill*

> *'Whatever space and time mean, place and occasion mean more.' -- Aldo van Eyck*

> *'If I don’t have red, I use blue.' -- Pablo Picasso*

HINT: Willpower is finite. So there are limits on change. Change requires attention.

HOWEVER...

> *'Preach the need for change, but never reform too much at once.' -- Robert Greene (45th law of power)*

<!--
stick to the plan. poople sabotage their one plans when it get tedious, nobnotusos, challegnig or too difficult. people think they need a new plan.

Be flexible. You need to be able to be a diplomate and a fighter, to speak well among the scholars of academia and the blue collar workers down at the bar.
You need to be comfortable both in a suit and tie and in camouflaged jacket.

Go With the Flow of Change
One of the biggest mistakes that you can make in any endeavor is to stick to rigidly to the old axioms and ways of thinking.
As Bruce Lee said “Be like water”, be willing to change and adapt to the world around you.

# 3.3 - On competing

### On creating imbalances

Create imbalances in your target to create an advantage and raise chances of winning.<br>
Use methods like [unpredictability](#on-unpredictability), [deceiving](#on-deceiving), [mirroring](#on-mirroring)
and [bait](#on-charming). Some opponents may require special tools.

> *'Keeping your enemies on the defensive and in react mode will have a demoralizing effect on them.'*

> *'If you control the overall direction and framing of the battle, anything they do will play into your hands.'*

HOWEVER... beware of counter-attacking.

> *'The problems created by an audacious move can be disguised, even remedied, by more and greater audacity.'*

> *'Whenever you find yourself on the defensive and in trouble, the greatest danger is the impulse to overreact.'*

<!-- 
> *'Moving first—initiating the attack—will often put you at a disadvantage: you are exposing your strategy and limiting your options.'* 
-->

### On charming

Charm the enemy and find their weaknesses. Then [exploit them](#on-deceiving).

> *'Instead of killing, charm the snake (once there are always more snakes) to fight the other ones. Listen actively and maintain rapport. Know your audience. First they have to [trust](#on-trust) you. Keep your word and prove your worth, the new guy as always to prove himself.'*

> *'Use selective honesty and generosity to disarm your victim.'<br>
'Pose as a friend, work as a spy.'<br>
'Discover each man’s thumbscrew.'<br>
'Work on the hearts and minds of others.' -- Robert Greene (12th, 14th, 33rd and 43rd law of power)*

> *'People's need for validation and recognition, their need to feel important, is the best kind of weakness to exploit.'*

> *'If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his own language, that goes to his heart.' -- Nelson Mandela*

> *'When you go up in an hierarchy, the need of persuasion is higher.<br>
To persuade up, focus in interests; to persuade down focus in emotions.'*

Use absence and bait to attract people.

> *'In the long run, the ability to make others come to you is a weapon far more powerful than any tool of aggression.'*

> *'Make other people come to you: use bait if necessary.'<br>
'Learn to keep people dependent on you.' -- Robert Greene (8th and 11th law of power)*

> *'Bait people into going out on a limb, exposing their weaknesses, then rake them with fire from the side.'*

> *'We attract more flies with honey than vinegar.'*

> *'Stay aloof and people will come to you. It will become a challenge for them to win your affections.'*

> *'Use absence to increase respect and honor.' -- Robert Greene (16th law of power)*

HOWEVER... use absence with [moderation](#on-balance).

> *'If you're always absent, soon you'll not be needed.'*

'Appear weak when you are strong and strong when you are weak.' -- Sun Tzu

> *'Court attention at all cost.'<br>
'Play to people’s fantasies.'<br>
'Create compelling spectacles.'<br>
'Stir up waters to catch fish.' -- Robert Greene (6th, 32nd, 37th and 39th law of power)*

> *'Play a sucker to catch a sucker - seem dumber than your mark.' -- Robert Greene (21st law of power)*

> *'By seeming stronger than you are, perhaps through an occasional act that is reckless and bold, you can deter the enemy from attacking you.'*

> *'Honesty is a very expensive gift, don't expect it from cheap people.' -- Warren Buffett*

HOWEVER... deceiving is not lying.

> *'Lying is like a nuclear bomb. The effects will be there for a long time to you to deal with.'*

'Say less than necessary.'<br>
'Keep others in suspended terror: cultivate an air of unpredictability.'<br>
'Assume formlessness.' -- Robert Greene (3rd, 4th, 17th and 48th law of power)*

HOWEVER... unpredictability can work against you: if you are in a subordinate position, it reduces trust.



---
### On mirroring

Mirroring works best when your group is in minority.

> *'Being pacifist in face of wolves is the source of endless tragedy.'*

> *'To change a status quo based on a minority, the majority must unite. To do that use non-violent organized action and humor, keeping the risk as low as possible so everybody can join your side.' -- Srdja Popovic*

> *'Disarm and infuriate with the mirror effect.' -- Robert Greene (44th law of power)*



---
### On opponents

1) Beware of easy opponents. Most times it's [bait](#on-charming).

> *'Despise the free lunch.' -- Robert Greene (40th law of power)*

> *'Sometimes one pays most for the things one gets for nothing.' -- Albert Einstein*

> *«El dorados» are never drawn in the map.'*

And desperate opponents will risk anything in a fight. This gives them a huge advantage, they have nothing to lose.

> *'Beware the fury of a patient man.' -- John Dryden*

> *'Use anger only as a tool, when you need it to improve your situation.'*

> *'Beware of sad people.'*
