# 3.1 - On preparing action

### On creativity, vision and ideas

*'The secret to creativity is knowing how to hide your sources.' -- Albert Einstein*

We don’t have an «imagination» we have a memory. Creative minds are rarely tidy.

> *'Good artists copy; great artists steal.' -- Steve Jobs & others*

> *'Those who do not want to imitate anything, produce nothing.' -- Salvador Dali*

> *'The new is the forgotten because everything has already happened.' -- Arturo Pérez Reverte*

> *'To invent, you need a good imagination and a pile of junk.' -- Thomas Edison*

> *'Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn't really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while.' -- Steve Jobs*

> *'Creativity and critical thinking: In subordinate position it gets you labelled a dreamer, a weirdo, or an idiot. In executive position, visionary, maverick, multidisciplinary thinker, etc. You can only truly creative in a position with autonomy, so you either climb the ladder or start your own thing.'*

#### How to find good ideas?

Ideas born out of free time, play and boredom. Ignorance is a bliss, gives you freedom to think about stuff. Being ignorant about the market and the «right way» to do things allows them to come up with creative solutions to problems that experienced veterans would never have thought of. See ignorance as a blessing.

Creativity is a muscle, you have to practice it every day. Once it stays the same, it's no longer creative. [Without new experiences, your soul rots](chapter_1_self.md#on-comfort-and-risk).

> *'The way to get good ideas is to get lots of ideas and throw the bad ones away.' -- Linus Pauling*

> *'We can’t solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them.' -- Albert Einstein*

> *'If you accept conventional wisdom from conventional people living conventional lives. Can you expect to be anything other than conventional?'*

> *'I cultivate empty space as a way of life for the creative process.' -- Josh Waitzkin*

> *'The secret to doing good research is always to be a little underemployed. You waste years by not being able to waste hours.' -- Amos Tversky*

> *'The mind that opens to a new idea never returns to its original size.' -- Albert Einstein*

#### What is the value of a good idea?

The right idea not executed is worth nothing, but a mediocre one well executed can prove to be worth much.

Forget all of your ideas. Instead, worry about transforming yourself into the kind of person who can execute and bring ideas to life.

> *'Ideas by themselves are roughly worthless. There's no market for them. There's no place where one can go and buy an idea. Describing your idea in detail doesn't mean other people will copy it. First they'll have to be convinced it's a good idea. If you ever tried to change anyone else's mind you know by now how hard that is. Not even founders themselves can predict how well their own ideas will do. And even if people are convinced your idea is a good idea, they'll still have to compare it to the existing idea they are already working on and see which one they're more likely to do well with.'*

> *'Ideas, then good ideas, then execution, then Do-ing, then networking, then idea sex, then turning an idea into a future vision, then monetizing the idea. Then more ideas.' -- James Altucher*

#### How to judge ideas?

- Best ideas come from the market, not from you.  
- Peers are the best judging ideas. Managers are the worse because they are outcome attached: they will regret more a false positive than a false negative.

<!--
- Creativity is linked to autonomy.
- Moments of originality and moments of conformity.
- Play is a gateway to possibility. Einstein called play the essential feature of productive thought.

> *'Far better an approximate answer to the right question, which is often vague, than an exact answer to the wrong question, which can always be made precise.' -- John Tukey*

### On analysis

*'Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts.' -- ALbert Einstein*

Analysis is an art, not a science. To find deep truths intuition is better than statistics.

> *'Statistics are like bikinis. What they reveal is suggestive, but what they conceal is vital.' -- Aaron Levenstein*

> *'«Dictator's dilemma»: when the vote goes 79% – 21% for some candidate we presume it was fair and represents a popular mandate. But when his excellency and Great Father of his People, gets 97% of the vote we say that is BS.'*

And, as such, error-prone by bias.

> *'Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth.' -- Marcus Aurelius*

> *'What Susie says of Sally says more about Susie than of Sally.'*

> *'Experiment and theory often show remarkable agreement when performed in the same laboratory' -- Daniel Bershader*

> *'The hardest thing to explain is the glaringly evident that everyone has decided not to see.' -- Ayn Rand*

> *'Each generation imagines itself to be more intelligent than the one that went before it, and wiser than the one that comes after it.' -- Orwell*

> *'Have you ever noticed that anybody driving slower than you is an idiot, and anyone going faster than you is a maniac?' -- George Carlin*

> *'Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect.' -- Mark Twain*

> *'Opinions are like a shirt: everyone should have at least a basic one, and it's okay to really love yours, but try to remember to change it every now and again.'*

> *'We don't look at what we look, but at what we are.' -- Fernando Pessoa*

> *'What the human being is best at doing is interpreting all new information so that their prior conclusions remain intact.' -- Warren Buffett*

One of the great problems with filters is our human tendency to think that what we see is all there is, without realizing that what we see is being filtered.

Be specially careful when facing new ideas. Too much info is also prone to bias: you'll always find confirmation to your pre-existing beliefs.

> *'You always get exaggerated notions of things you don’t know anything about.' -- Albert Camus*

> *'I am both worse and better than you thought.' -- Sylvia Plath*

> *'Nothing is as simple at seems at first, or as hopeless as it seems in the middle, or as finished as it seems in the end.'*

> *'An unfamiliar city is a fine thing. That’s the time and place when you can suppose that all of the people you meet are nice.' -- Louis Céline*

- Randomness: most facts are a «tell» but some are just random.

> *'Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.' -- Sigmund Freud*

- [Being deceived](#on-deceiving).

> *'Don't tell me what you value. Show me your budget, and I'll tell you what you value.' -- Joe Biden quoting his father*

Hints on the art of analysis:

- Pay attention to negative cues: what should have happened but did not.  
- «Chekov bottle»: If something is described in a previous chapter, it means it will be important for the action in a future chapter.  
- We always think that the people who agree with us are really smart.  
- Skepticism is a great servant and a terrible master.  
- Sometimes we know that A+B=C but we don’t realize that A=C-B

> *'Look for something that doesn't make sense. That's where the gold mine is: «It doesn't make sense, the price is going down!». The world makes sense, just not the model. Some X factor is hidden. Don't try to make sense of the world. It's too complicated. Instead watch investors attempting to make sense of it. They're the ones that will make the assets price move.'  
'look for the obvious: «Do you want to be a writer? You should have something to say.»'  
'The most important question: «What do you need to see to change your view?»' -- Adam Robinson (paraphrased)*

> *'The most valuable insights are both general and surprising. Ordinarily, the best that people can do is one without the other: either surprising without being general (e.g. gossip), or general without being surprising (e.g. cliches).' -- Paul Graham*

> *'I look for ways of changing my mind. I never allow myself to have an opinion on anything that I don't know the other side's argument better than they do. ' -- Chalie Munger*

> *'The truth is rarely pure and never simple.' -- Oscar Wilde*

> *'When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.' -- Goodhart's Law*

> *'That's the thing about counterintuitive ideas, they contradict your intuitions. Of course your first impulse is to ignore them' -- Paul Graham*

> *'That which can be asserted without evidence, can be dismissed without evidence.' -- Christopher Hitchens*

> *'I conceive that the great part of the miseries of mankind are brought upon them by false estimates they have made of the value of things.' -- Benjamin Franklin*

> *'Things which are different in order to be different are seldom better, but that which is made to be better is almost always different.' -- Dieter Rams*

#### How to judge a man?

Society judges people by what they can do for others. But we judge ourselves by our thoughts.

> *'Judge a man by his questions, not by his answers.' -- Voltaire*

> *'We should not judge people by their peak of excellence; but by the distance they have traveled from the point where they started.' -- Henry Ward Beecher*

> *'It isn't what we say or think that defines us, but what we do.' -- Jane Austen*

> *'Whenever you feel like criticizing any one... just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.' -- F. Scott Fitzgerald*

<!--
> *'To understand is to know what to do.' -- Wittgenstein*
> *'Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing.' -- Oscar Wilde*

E.g. if you tell someone the person they’re about to meet is extroverted, they’re more likely to describe them as extroverted.

- Any time you don't know, be clear that you don't know, but follow up with a plan for how you'll get the information and with a deadline for conveying that information. That is all the person asking the question really wants anyway: for you to supply the answer.

tese antitheses -> syntesis

- reasoning by first principles and reasoning by analogy. correlations is not causation
- There is too much going on – too many decisions and interactions happening in every moment – for us to be able to conclude cause and effect with any certainty.
- aditional information only feeds your confirmation bias
- The very act of stopping to think before you say or do anything almost always improves the quality of your ultimate response.
- Ask yourself “does this decision require fast or slow thinking?” 
- Create a hypothesis, a yet-to-be-proven theory. Then seek ways to invalidate this hypothesis, to prove that your idea is wrong. This is what scientists do. This is exactly the opposite of what most people do. They come up with an idea, and then they seek corroboration and proof that their idea is a good one. They practice “confirmation bias.” They only look for confirmation of the validity of the idea, and they simultaneously reject all input or information that is inconsistent with what they have already decided to believe.
Create a negative or reverse hypothesis. This is the opposite of your initial theory. For example, you are Isaac Newton, and the idea of gravity has just occurred to you. Your initial hypothesis would be that “things fall down.” You then attempt to prove the opposite—“things fall up.” If you cannot prove the reverse or negative hypothesis of your idea, you can then conclude that your hypothesis is correct.
- best way to deal with confirmation bias: You need to search out disconfirming evidence.
- confirmaton bias, the mother of all bias. In truth, we all believe in things we can’t prove. If you’re intelligent, well-educated, and good at pulling facts, you’re going to be even better at confirming your own beliefs than someone who’s less intelligent or well-educated. Our brains are wired so that we make better lawyers than we do scientists, in that a lawyer will look for and use evidence to support their client, while ignoring and definitely not using evidence that does the opposite. We only want to watch television shows or read articles or listen to podcasts that confirm what we already believe -- what we already think we know.

Confirmation bias is our tendency to cherry pick information which confirms pre-existing beliefs or ideas.
Two people with opposing views on a topic can see the same evidence, and still come away both validated by it
We can be cautious of data which seems to immediately support our views.The desire to be right is the thirst for truth.
Evaluating evidence (especially when it is complicated or unclear) requires a great deal of mental energy. Our brains prefer to take shortcuts.
This saves the time needed to make decisions, in particular when under pressure.

Accepting information which confirms our beliefs is easy and requires little mental energy. Yet contradicting information causes us to shy away, grasping for a reason to discard it.

The key concept of emergence that is at play here is that components of a system self-organize to produce a state of affairs that is neither obvious nor predictable if you focus on the capabilities of the components themselves.

What’s your advantage: informational, analytical, or behavioral?
	
- not playing your hand but playing your opponent.

- The first time it breaks, you blame the manufacturer. The second time, and every time after that, you blame the repair shop. For a repair shop, servicing appliances from a bad vendor can damage your reputation. Since then, every time I make an appliance purchase – vacuum cleaner, dishwasher, car – I go to a repair shop. They’re always excited to talk to someone who will listen. They may even have a used model that will last you for years.

Simple rules focus on the critical variables that govern a situation and help you ignore the peripheral ones. Of course, in order to identify the key variables, you need to be operating in your circle of competence.

Yes, you should have a strong, crystal clear vision and end game, but you must be flexible about how you achieve that vision.

rational and irrational players

Key variables that you need to maximize and minimize, and follow the agile path blazed by Henry Singleton (My only plan is to keep coming to work. … I like to steer the boat each day rather than plan ahead way into the future.)

Knowing what you want is not enough, you must have a very clear blueprint for the specific actions you are going to take in order to achieve your end game

Everybody is a genious but if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.

- um texto historico é biased/shortsighted mais que um gráfico historico onde cada um tira as suas comclusoes.

> *'A map is not the territory it represents, but, if correct, it has a similar structure to the territory, which accounts for its usefulness.' -- Alfred Korzybski, Science and Sanity*

Lewis Carroll stated “we are what we believe we are”, but it seems that the world is also what we believe it to be.

- The most difficult subjects can be explained to the most slow-witted man if he has not formed any idea of them already; but the simplest thing cannot be made clear to the most intelligent man if he is firmly persuaded that he knows already, without a shadow of doubt, what is laid before him. Much of this is the result of our need for cognitive consistency. As a consequence, we tend to see more evidence which enforces our worldview. Confirmatory data is taken seriously, while disconfirmatory data is treated with scepticism. To constantly evaluate our worldview would be exhausting, so we prefer to strengthen it. confirmation bias: As music unfolds, the brain constantly updates its estimates of when new beats will occur, and takes satisfaction in matching a mental beat with a real-in-the-world one.

> *'The eye sees only what the mind is prepared to comprehend.' -- Robertson Davies*

- You need to search out disconfirming evidence.
- fascinated by models. how the invisible afects the visible
- you're always looking to patterns of differences! pattern recognition

As Rebecca Goldstein wrote in Incompleteness: The Proof and Paradox of Kurt Godel: All truths -- even those that had seemed so certain as to be immune to the very possibility of revision -- are essentially manufactured. Indeed, the very notion of the objectively true is a socially constructed myth. Our knowing minds are not embedded in truth. Rather, the entire notion of truth is embedded in our minds, which are themselves the unwitting lackeys of organizational forms of influence.

Truth in stereotypes there'es truth on GROUP opinions. Steryotypes are the falsy _group_ opinions that account for a small amout. groups opinios self correct themselves.

Every word someone says is the tip of the iceberg. Underneath that word are thoughts, fears, emotions. Underneath those emotions is history and experiences. A single word is the final outcome of all of that history.

### On planning

*'All battles are won or lost before they are ever fought.' -- Sun Tzu*

Plan ahead and prepare for the highly probable scenarios.  
Make the decisions right now. When in the moment of making the decision, you have already done it.

> *'The best way to predict the future is to invent it.' -- Alan Kay*

> *'If I had 9 hours to chop down a tree, I'd spend the first six sharpening my ax.' -- Abraham Lincoln*

> *'He who fails to plan is planning to fail.' -- Winston Churchill*

You can’t predict. You can prepare.

> *'The movie might be good or bad but in the end we'll finish eating pizza.'*

> *'Hope is not a strategy.' -- Vince Lombardi*

> *'You have choices. Choices are experiments.'*

#### How to plan? 

Start with a [vision](#on-creativity-vision-and-ideas). Then look for actionable steps.  
Choose the plan with more options. The one that lets you change plan.

### On decision making

*'May your choices reflect your choices, not your fears.' -- Nelson Mandela*

*'A well defined problem seeks its own solution' -- Mike Brundant*

*'I am not a product of my circumstances. I am a product of my decisions.' -- Stephen Cove*

The ability to make fast decisions is a competitive advantage. How to decide?
 
- Is the decision reversible or irreversible? If it is reversible, we can make it fast and without perfect information. If a decision is irreversible, we had 
better slow down the decision-making process and ensure that we consider ample information and understand the problem as thoroughly as we can.

Decision-making heuristics to remove the need for deliberation in particular situations:

- Default to no (steve jobs)
- Hell yes or no (derek sivers)
- No to any decision that requires a calculator or computer (Warren Buffett)
- Reversible or irreversible decision (jeff bezos)

> *'Hell yes or no.' -- Derek Sivers*

> *'My brother says to never make a big decision before you take a shower.'*

However some people get paralyzed by [over thinking](#on-starting-and-timing). If you think too much, you’ll create a problem that wasn’t there in the first place.'*

> *'While we are reasoning concerning life, life is gone.' -- David Hume*

> *'Opportunity cost is how intelligent people assess things.' -- Charlie Munger*

This is why research in rapid cognition says that we make our decisions intuitively most of the time. It’s like buying a house. You make a list of all the things you want, and then usually it comes to down a feeling: «I don’t know why, but I just like this one».

Mental models are decision making helpers.

> *'All models are wrong but some are useful.' -- George Box*

<!--
> *'Decisions are made based on memory. There are 3 routes: reflex (genetics), habits or goals. Influence their memories and you can influence their decisions.'*
> *'My first thought, is never my best thought. My first thought is always someone else’s; it’s always what I’ve already heard about the subject, always the conventional wisdom.' -- William Deresiewicz*

It’s a common belief that your first reaction is the most honest, but I disagree. Your first reaction is usually outdated. Either it’s an answer you came up with long ago and now use instead of thinking, or it’s triggering a knee-jerk emotional response to something that happened long ago. -- Derek Sivers
	
> *'Economics teaches you that making a choice means giving up something.' -- Russ Roberts*
> *'#346. The senses do not deceive; it is the judgment that deceives.' -- goethe*
> *'We have two kinds of forecasters: The ones who don’t know and the ones who don’t know they don’t know.'*
we have to feel we know enough to take action

- as all the great questions. answers are always evolving
- Easy come, easy go: Quickly done can be quickly undone. To last an eternity requires an eternity of preparation. -- Balthasar Gracian
- oftentimes, the most important decision that you will make is not whether or not you should start something, but whether or not you should stay with something.
- estimates are promises. What makes promises special is that once you promise something it is expected that you ACT upon realizing it. No one that has no 'skin in the game' should give estimates.

- My New Strategy: Test Stuff Out - trial first! “Is this the smallest thing we can do to test our riskiest assumption?”

With practice, we also get better at recognizing bad decisions and pivoting, rather than sticking with past choices due to the sunk costs fallacy. Equally important, we can stop viewing mistakes or small failures as disastrous and view them as pure information which will inform future decisions.
As further guidance, Bezos considers 70% certainty to be the cut-off point where it is appropriate to make a decision. That means acting once we have 70% of the required information, instead of waiting longer. Making a decision at 70% certainty and then course-correcting is a lot more effective than waiting for 90% certainty.

Beliefs lag behind reality.

But think about some of the things you believed ten years ago… aren’t you embarrassed by some of them? Don’t you wonder how you could’ve ever believed something so ridiculous? Yeah. Exactly. So what are you going to think about the beliefs you have now in ten years?
Knowledge is always moving forward, and it’s probably moving forward a lot faster now than it ever has been. So if we’re going to assume anything, it shouldn’t be that we’re right, but that we’re wrong. Better to be a skeptic than to be delusional.

- If you don't understand the limitations of the model, you don't understand the model.  
- Remember that all models are wrong; the practical question is how wrong do they have to be to not be useful.  
- A model is a simplification which fosters understanding. The wrong way to understand models: Too literally.  
- Think of mental models as minimum viable products. Sure, all of them can be improved. But the only way that can happen is if we try them out, educate ourselves and collectively refine them. Your kitchen knives are not as sharp as they could be. Does that matter as long as they still cut vegetables? Your bed is not as comfortable as it could be. Does that matter if you can still get a good night’s sleep in it? Your internet is not as fast as it could be. Does that matter as long as you can load this article? Arguably not. Our world runs on the functional, not the perfect. This is what a mental model is – a functional tool. A tool which maybe could be a bit sharper or easier to use, but still does the job.

Georg Rasch said the following:
When you construct a model you leave out all the details which you, with the knowledge at your disposal, consider inessential…. Models should not be true, but it is important that they are applicable, and whether they are applicable for any given purpose must, of course, be investigated. This also means that a model is never accepted finally, only on trial.

As we know, the map is not the territory. A map can be seen as a symbol or index of a place, not an icon.

> *'A map is not the territory it represents, but, if correct, it has a similar structure to the territory, which accounts for its usefulness.' -- Alfred Korzybski*

Physical maps generally become more accurate as time passes. Not long ago, they often included countries which didn’t exist, omitted some which did, portrayed the world as flat or fudged distances. Nowadays, our maps have come a long way.

The same goes for mental models – they are always evolving, being revised – never really achieving perfection. Certainly, over time, the best models are revised only slightly, but we must never consider our knowledge “set”.

> *'A model which took account of all the variation of reality would be of no more use than a map at the scale of one to one.' -- Joan Robinson*

Too many people are caught up wasting time on physics-like precision in areas of practical life that do not have such precision available. A better approach is to ask “is it useful?” and, if yes, “To what extent?”

Mental models are a way of thinking about the world that prepares us to make good decisions in the first place.

The critical point for any innovation is the transition from the early adapters to the sceptics, for at this point there is a ‘chasm'.

<!--
His hypothesis was that white families had different levels of tolerance for the number of people of racial minorities in their neighborhoods. Some white families were completely racist; others were not concerned with the race of their neighbors. As increasing numbers of racial minorities moved into neighborhoods, the most racist people would soon leave. Then a tipping point would occur — a critical mass of white people would leave until the area was populated by racial minorities. This phenomenon became known as “white flight

Critical Mass in Psychology
Psychologists have known for a long time that groups of people behave differently than individuals.
Sometimes when we are in a group, we tend to be less inhibited, more rebellious, and more confident. This effect is known as mob behaviour. (An interesting detail is that mob psychology is one of the few branches of psychology which does not concern individuals.) As a general rule, the larger the crowd, the less responsibility people have for their behaviour. (This is also why individuals and not groups should make decisions.)

In Zero to One, Peter Thiel describes how PayPal achieved the critical mass of users needed for it to be useful:
For PayPal to work, we needed to attract a critical mass of at least a million users. Advertising was too ineffective to justify the cost. Prospective deals with big banks kept falling through. So we decided to pay people to sign up.
We gave new customers $10 for joining, and we gave them $10 more every time they referred a friend. This got us hundreds of thousands of new customers and an exponential growth rate.

The Problems With Goals:
-Goals have an enndpoint
-Goals rely on factors which we do not always have control over.
-Goals rely on willpower and self-discipline.
-Keeping a goal in mind and using it to direct our actions requires constant willpower.
-Goals can make us complacent or reckless.

even the best and most useful maps suffer from limitations, and Korzybski gives us a few to explore: (A.) The map could be incorrect without us realizing it; (B.) The map is, by necessity, a reduction of the actual thing, a process in which you lose certain important information; and (C.) A map needs interpretation, a process that can cause major errors. (The only way to truly solve the last would be an endless chain of maps-of-maps, which he called self-reflexiveness.)

“Knowing what you don’t know is more useful than being brilliant.”
“Acknowledging what you don’t know is the dawning of wisdom.”
“People are trying to be smart—all I am trying to do is not to be idiotic, but it’s harder than most people think.”
“It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent.”

Map and Terrain
“At Berkshire there has never been a master plan. Anyone who wanted to do it, we fired because it takes on a life of its own and doesn’t cover new reality. We want people taking into account new information.”

Detailed 5-year plans (that will clearly be wrong) are as disastrous as overly-general five year plans (which can never be wrong). Scrap it, isolate the 

“Know the big ideas in the big disciplines and use them routinely-- all of them, not just a few.”

you don't win by predicting the future; you win by getting the odds right. You can be right about the future and still not make any money. At the racetrack, for example, the favorite horse may be the one most likely to win, but since everyone wants to bet on the favorite, how likely is it that betting on the favorite will make you money? The horse to bet on is the one more likely to win than most people expect. That's the one that gives you the best odds. That's the bet that pays off over time. -- will bonner

The ability to destroy your ideas rapidly instead of slowly when the occasion is right is one of the most valuable things.

As Rabbi Moses ben Maimon (1135-1204), commonly known as Maimonides, said: “Teach thy tongue to say I do not know, and thou shalt progress.”
Great thinkers, like Darwin, did the work necessary to hold an opinion. And it's one of the biggest reasons he's buried at Westminster Abbey. Doing the work counteracts our natural desire seek out only information that confirms what we believe we know.

Most of the time people don't put us to the test. When they do, the results don't match our confidence.

If you want to win an argument, ask the person trying to convince you of something to explain how it would work.
Odds are they have not done the work required to hold an opinion. If they can explain why they are correct and how things would work, you'll learn something. If they can't you'll soften their views, perhaps nudging them ever so softly toward your views.

Always assume that you’re wrong from a purely philosophical point of view. We are always wrong about whatever we believe. Knowledge is always moving forward, and if you think about things you used to believe 10 years ago or five years ago, it embarrasses you now. And the things that you hold dear and hold to be true today are likely going to embarrass you in 10 or 20 years from now. 

Say no to things you aren’t really excited about doing. Hell yes or no. The mediocre robs you of the great. sivers 

Make decisions about what you want to do ideally on the front end rather than tracking what you do on the back end. Planning a diet vs. recording a diet. Making decisions under stress vs making decisions when relaxed and clear headed.

we think we make choices but our choices are affected by others. (ex of naming a child)
people pick what is familiar. people are influenced without us realizing.
working class want to feel the same as others.
white collar want to feel different from others.

decisions are tainted by the emotional investments you accumulate, and the more you invest in something the harder it becomes to abandon it.

Clarity is the Key to All Success: without a clear roadmap for who we are and what we want to achieve, we will never find true success.
You must know exactly what you want, when you want it, and why you want it.
Without this clarity, you will find yourself wandering aimlessly for years, or even decades of your life and looking back, wishing that you’d had more direction.

# 3.2 - On executing

### On starting and timing

*'A year from now, you will wish you had started today.' -- Karen Lamb*

Just start. Stop making resolutions and start making something.

> *'The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step' -- Lao Tzu*

> *'You don't have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great.' -- Zig Ziglar*

> *'Waiting for troubles to come to you will only multiply them and give them a deadly momentum.'*

> *'A good plan, violently executed now, is better than a perfect plan next week.' -- General George Patton*

> *'If everybody contemplates the infinite instead of fixing the drains, many of us will die of cholera.' -- John Rich*

> *'Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can.' -- Arthur Ashe*

Why people procrastinate?

- [Perfectionism](chapter_1_self.md#on-perfectionism)  
- Fear (of change). Procrastination is deeply tied to anxiety.  
- Lack of urgency / deadlines (the panic monster) Pressed by circumstances, we feel unusually energized and focused.  
- No inspiration or opportunities -- the inspiration you are waiting for, in order to start, is on the other side of starting. Momentum generates motivation.  
- no preparation. you can learn while you do it.  

> *'Go and do the things you can’t. That is how you get to do them.' -- Pablo Picasso*

> *'We distract ourselves because we are not willing to face up with what bothers us.'*

> *'When hope disappears, so does action'*

> *'What gets measured gets done.'*

- Major epiphany: Energy creates motion, motion creates emotions, and women are highly emotional beings.
- Total efficiency constrains us. We become super invested in maintaining the status quo because that is where we excel. Innovation is a threat. Change is terrifying. Being perfect at something is dangerous if it’s the only thing you can do.

At some point, the pain of not doing it becomes greater than the pain of doing it. -> law of procrastination

the most difficult is the decision to act, the rest is just tenacity. -- andrea earhart

Play the ball before it plays you.

“[S]ome systems … are very sensitive to their starting conditions, 
so that a tiny difference in the initial push you give them 
causes a big difference in where they end up, and there is 
feedback, so that what a system does affects its own behavior.”
-- John Gribbin, Deep Simplicity

your feelings don’t mean shit. It’s only your actions.

If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you’ll never get it done. Make at least one definite move daily toward your goal. -- Bruce Lee

research is not doing something!
define milestones to know when to stop your research

[Knowledge is Never the Issue, action is]

Forget All About Doing Good Work and Focus on Great Work
Good work, on the other hand, is an innocuous killer of greatness.
Good work is often what we use to fill our time and distract ourselves from great work we know we should be doing
Good work is that high-paying freelance project that distracts your focus from your new startup. Or that client you keep on retainer who doesn’t push your abilities or stretch you.

Bad execution of your designs does less harm than irresolution in forming them.

STRATEGIC LAZINESS AS A LEVERAGE POINT

WORK THAT PRODUCES DIMINISHING (OR EVEN NEGATIVE) RETURNS
Imagine that you went outside and jogged for 10 minutes. This would be a healthy thing to do.
Now imagine you went outside and ran for 20 minutes. It’d also be healthy, but it wouldn’t necessarily be twice as healthy as the 10 minutes.
But she noticed that most of this extra time was pretty ineffective. The four hours at the end of the day, from say 6 PM to 10 PM, contributed about as much usable work as the first two hours of the day. People were essentially slaving away for marginal benefits.
And in worst case scenarios, people would start producing bad work or make bad decisions because they were so tired. And when you accumulate enough bad work and bad decisions, you actually unintentionally create more work for yourself. So you go from working for diminishing returns to working for negative returns.

The more “goal oriented” is the task, the more a potential 10x programmer

If 20% of the effort creates 80% of the value (think of a job: 20% of the employees do 80% of the work), then square that.
So now 20% of the 20% of the effort makes 80% of 80% of the value.
So 4% of the work you do in life creates 64% of the benefits in your life.

One of the biggest mistakes that people make is that they are outcome oriented, not process oriented.

I love how the '80/20' rule gets stretched so often that in this article it talks about hyperdominate trees that take up 50% of the Amazon. So 80/20 can go anywhere form 99/1 to 50/50. What an interesting 'pattern'.

The martial art kung fu literally translates into two words. Effort and time.
And the only things that are standing between you and your goals are these two factors.

Make your _business_ case, not a technical case
Sometimes writing a one-off script will take 30 minutes, and doing it by hand will take 10. Do it by hand.

stop lionizing efficiency, and start asking the question that has guided craftsmen for millennia: what’s the most effective way for me to accomplish the things that are most important?

This is the path to improvement any area of life.

Your productivity as a manager is measured as the productivity of your team. This is why, above, I wrote that sitting at your desk can be detrimental to your productivity. I think the key principle is putting your team’s productivity first, instead of your own, individual productivity. Remember, you are a communication hub and a multiplier. Think about what is best for others, and think about the things you can delegate vs. the things that only you can do.
Ideally, the 'captain' would remain technical, and fight the war against complexity alongside his team. depends on the size of the team.

productivity methods dont bnecessarily add value to your career. making stuff that others can't do
But in order to build an awesome career doing hard but satisfying long-term work, you need to build your ability to focus for hours at a time. You need to learn hard skills. You need to let go of multitasking, distraction, and the temptation to be “busy.

“People tend to abandon the good system they’ll follow in search of the perfect system that they will quit.”

The key take-aways from the Pyramid Principle at McKinsey were:
- Start with the answer first.
- Group and summarize your supporting arguments.
- Logically order your supporting ideas.

Then, for each supporting idea or argument, break that further into more ideas or arguments until you have formed a pyramid. The Pyramid Principle teaches that, “Ideas at any level in the pyramid must always be summaries of the ideas grouped below them.”

The Rule of 3. Whenever you’re trying to persuade a senior person to do something, always present 3 reasons. Not 2, not 4, but exactly 3.
“There are 3 reasons why we should do this” and then proceed to list my reasons in almost a numbered bullet point format (“First…”, “Second…”, and “Last…”).

I observed that The Rule of 3 was actually pretty effective in persuading clients to take action. Why? Three reasons:
- Your argument gets their attention and is memorable
- You are forced to choose the 3 most important reasons
- You sound more structured, confident and decisive when you speak

- Organizing is not just for making your house clean or your room tidy; the end goal is to clarify your values.

- Have a Mission. Every day, whether it’s “be creative today.” Or “go some place you’ve never been” or “talk to ten random strangers”, make a mission. Learn something new. Missions are for people who DO. Mission statements are for people who DON’T.
- Nothing happens in the world because of thought. Or because of talking. Or because of writing. It happens because of DO-ing.
- Knowing is half the battle, the other half is action implementing that knowledge to your own advantage.
- Time is the most precious thing you own.

### On speed, position and direction

*'Speed is useful only if you are running in the right direction.' -- Joel Barker*

Direction is more important than velocity.

> *'Moving in a direction opposite to what we are doing right now where we are not successful will guarantee success.'*

> *'When you run, make sure you run to something and not away from.' -- The Avett Brothers*

Don’t be afraid to take time away to find it. Only fools rush into a situation. By committing too quickly you lose your maneuverability.

> *'Trees that are slow to grow bear the best fruit.' -- Molière*

15. Waiting may be the best course of action. A fountain gets muddy with but little stirring up, and does not get clear by our meddling with it but by our leaving it alone. -- Balthasar Gracian

7. Be patient. You must pass through the circumference of time before arriving at the centre of opportunity. A wise reserve seasons the aims and matures the means. Time’s crutch effects more than the iron club of Hercules. God Himself chasteneth not with a rod but with time. He spake a great word who said, “Time and I against any two.” Fortune herself rewards waiting with the first prize. -- Balthasar Gracian

Velocity and speed are different things. Speed is the distance traveled over time. I can run around in circles with a lot of speed and cover several miles that way, but I’m not getting anywhere. Velocity measures displacement. It’s direction-aware.

Here are three ways you can increase your velocity:

- To the extent possible, ruthlessly shave away the unnecessary tasks, priorities, meetings, and BS. Put all your effort into the projects that really matter.
- Don’t rely on your willpower to say no; instead, create systems that help you fend off distractions.example: One of my management principles was “no meeting mornings.”
- say “no” to your boss.

- No podemos elegir nuestro origen pero podemos elegir hacia donde ir

### On focus, priorities and productivity

*'A woodpecker can tap twenty times on a thousand trees and get nowhere, but stay busy.  
Or he can tap twenty-thousand times on one tree and get dinner.' -- Seth Godin (The Dip)* 

Time itself is not your limitation: attention is. You’re always managing attention, not time.
Focusing is an art.

> *'Busy imply out of control. lack of time is lack of priorities.'*

First the essential. Then the details.

> *'Concentrate your forces.'  
'Strike the shepherd and the sheep will scatter.' -- Robert Greene (23rd and 42nd law of power)*

> *'You can do anything, but not everything.' -- David Allen*

> *'People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I’m actually as proud of the things we haven’t done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying ‘no’ to 1,000 things.' -- Steve Jobs*

> *'It's not what you read, it's what you ignore.' -- Scott Hanselman*

> *'A man with a watch knows what time it is. A man with two watches is never sure.'*

> *'I want to know God's thoughts; the rest are details.' -- Albert Einstein*

> *'You only have to do a very few things right in your life so long as you don't do too many things wrong.' -- Warren Buffett*
you're not perfect in everything. find your specialty.

> *'When everything is a priority nothing is a priority. Attempting to maximize competing variables is a recipe for disaster. Picking one variable, and relentlessly focusing on it, which is an effective strategy, diverges from the norm. It's hard to compete with businesses who have correctly identified the right variables to maximize or minimize.' -- Charlie Munger*

> *'Always look where you want to go, not where you don't want to go.'*

> *'Without commitment, you cannot have depth in anything, whether it's a relationship, a business or a hobby.' -- Neil Strauss*

> *'Learn what is to be taken seriously and laugh at the rest.' -- Hermann Hesse*

> *'As the biggest library if it is in disorder is not as useful as a small but well-arranged one, so you may accumulate a vast amount of knowledge but it will be of far less value to you than a much smaller amount if you have not thought it over for yourself' -- Arthur Schopenhauer*

[Perfectionism](chapter_1_self.md#on-perfectionism) is as bad as procrastination.

Work by layers: functional -> perfect; 
Do less to achieve more. Make the basics in life and you're good to go. You don't need to optimise.

Hints on productivity:

- Focus just on 3 outcomes (not todos) per day and tackle your most important thing (MIT) first thing in the morning.  
- Focus on the one thing most likely to get maximum results. Forget everything else. Leverage is built on the notion that small, well-focused actions can sometimes produce significant, enduring improvements if they are applied in the right place. Tacking a difficult problem is often a matter of seeing where the high leverage lies. Focus on doing the right things instead of doing things right. 
- Do things in batch. Interruption and switching between tasks costs too much. Reduce decision making on small tasks to a minimum and do it quickly and in bulk, Too many options may paralize you: remove them.
- when a task will take you less than two minutes, just do it—don’t add it to your to-do list or capture it for later.
- Be fully present: learn to focus on what you are doing now;  
- Set specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and time-based goals.  
- Set process goals (which help you achieve a larger goal).
- Identify keystone habits (e.g. waking up early)
- Buy yourself time. Delegate.

HOWEVER...

2) Manage emotions to better manage time: it’s your beliefs that create your feelings, not reality.
procrastination is a mood-management technique
3) Important Beats Urgent
You do what’s easy or urgent, not what really moves the needle.
Since the vast majority of our words and actions are unnecessary, corralling them will create an abundance of leisure and tranquility. As a result, we shouldn’t forget at each moment to ask, is this one of the unnecessary things?
Getting a lot of unnecessary things done is not productivity; it’s stupidity.
Doing something well does not make it important. I think this is one of the most common problems with a lot of time-management or productivity advice; they focus on how to do things quickly. The vast majority of things that people do quickly should not be done at all. -- tim ferriss
4) Focus On Effort, Not Outcome
What’s that have to do with productivity? Plenty. Because you worry about all kinds of stuff that you can’t do anything about. And that’s wasted time and energy.
And neuroscience research shows that by focusing on what you have control over, you decrease stress.
You can’t control whether it ends up as a “robbery” or an “attempted robbery”, just focus on executing the heist in a way that would make mom proud.

- Top performers definitely focus on fewer goals — but they also obsess like crazy over them.
- “Occam’s Razor” says the simplest answer is often the best. So start ruthlessly cutting all the activities in your workday that aren’t producing value.
- Mind the process, not the results. For example, “finish TPS report” might turn into “write TPS report for 45 uninterrupted minutes.”
- there are only three ways in which you can increase productivity: Increase the physical, mental, and emotional energy you have available for each task. Doing more of the right things and fewer unnecessary things. Improve the systems that you use to complete a given task or project. In other words, the three paths to productivity are: Energy - Effectiveness - Efficiency: productivity is about understanding your constraints. getting the right things done
- saying yes to everything is a quick road to mediocrity.
- “Instead of asking how many tasks you can tackle given your working hours,” writes Morten Hansen in Great at Work, “ask how many you can ditch given what you must do to excel.” I did what I needed to do to keep my job. As John Stuart Mill said, “as few as you can, as many as you must.”
- Busy is a decision. What you are really saying: is not a priority. Is a excuse for not doing something we don't feel like doing.
- Only operate from strengths: outsource your weaknesses. Focus on what you’re naturally good at and what you enjoy the most.
- Focus on adaptability not effectiveness

### On control

*'You can lead a horse to water but you can’t make him drink.'* 

Control what you can: [what you’re primed by](), [who you are around](), the ideas and problems you [focus]() on.  
Ignore the rest.

> *'If things seem under control, you're just not going fast enough.' -- Mario Andretti (F1 pilot)*

> *'One’s real life is often the life that one does not lead.' -- Oscar Wilde*

- control is the master adiction.
- focus on what doesnt change

### On balance

Life is a balancing act.

The dose makes the poison: things in excess become their opposite.  
The hardest skill is knowing when to stop.

> *'Do not go past the mark you aimed for; in victory, learn when to stop.' -- Robert Greene (47th law of power)*

> *'The hardest skill is knowing what could be simplified, and what's good enough.'*

> *'Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.'*

> *'If half of the room laughs and half doesn't is a success.'*

> *'A balance sheet must balance.'*

> *'Most things are not binary.'*

Balance is not about spending the same amount of time focused on every area of your life either. It's about making progress in all areas of your life and ensuring that you improve just a little bit each day in your health, wealth, relationships, and personal growth.

> *'Don’t try to make your job your whole life. Don’t try to make your art your sole income.'*

Diversification solves a lot of problems.

#### How to balance an imbalance?

Overcompensate. Some people get passion from something they struggled with.

self improvement as a limit: 20% will give 80% of results.

MM
There are two approaches to improving yourself:
1) The self-improvement junkie. 
2) The self-improvement tourists.
I would argue that self-help tourists are using self-improvement advice in a healthy manner and that self-help junkies are (often, but not always) using it in an unhealthy manner. Remember, the paradoxical point of all self-improvement is to reach a point where you no longer feel you need to improve yourself. Therefore, the constant indulgence in self-improvement material just continues to feed that feeling of inadequacy.
Where does it end? It doesn’t. At least not until you decide it does.
Because the only way to truly benefit from self-improvement is to one day arrive at a place where you no longer need it. Like a cast for a broken arm. Or a bandage for a deep cut. You put it on, let it heal you. And then you take it off and move on with your life.

The 80/20 Principle states that 80% of the output or results will come from 20% of the input or action.

> *'Growth for growth’s sake is the ideology of the cancer cell.' -- Edward Abbey*

Enough is the opposite of hunger. The counter to paranoia. The antidote to anxiety.

Exponential growth devours and corrupts. There is no higher God in Silicon Valley than growth. No sacrifice too big for its craving altar. As long as you keep your curve exponential, all your sins will be forgotten at the exit.

Disease of More.

### On change and adapting

*'However beautiful the strategy, you should occasionally look at the results.' -- Winston Churchill*

*'Life is more like tetris than chess.'*

Plans are not static. You need to switch strategies a few times to get where you want to go.

> *'I am a man of fixed and unbending principles, the first of which is to be flexible at all times.' -- Everett Dirksen*

> *'Take advantage of the opportunities - that’s probably more important than charting your path.'-- Admiral William Mcraven*

> *'One should not be too straightforward. Go & see the forest. The straight trees are cut down, the crooked ones are left standing.' -- Kautilya*

> *'The most important thing to do if you find yourself in a hole is to stop digging.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'What got you here won't get you there.'*

> *'The directions to get you anywhere include a few turns:  
Sometimes you need to say YES to everything and be open to growth;  
Sometimes you need to say NO to everything and focus.  
It's scary to make those direction choices but fear is a great road sign.'  
-- Derek Sivers (paraphrased)*

> *'Whatever space and time mean, place and occasion mean more.' -- Aldo van Eyck*

> *'If I don’t have red, I use blue.' -- Pablo Picasso*

> *'When things break, it's not the actual breaking that prevents them from getting back together again. It's because a little piece gets lost - the two remaining ends couldn't fit together even if they wanted to. The whole shape has changed.' -- John Green*

Adapt instead of reacting. Small changes in a complex system can cause sudden and large changes.

> *'When the winds of change blow, some people build walls while others build windmills.' -- Chinese proverb*

> *'Surely by now I’m desperate enough to change.' -- John Tottenham*

HINT: Willpower is finite. So there are limits on change. Change requires attention.

> *'Preach the need for change, but never reform too much at once.' -- Robert Greene (45th law of power)*

<!--
> *'Listen to predict a collapse.'*

- Inertia is why a car does not stop the moment the brakes are applied.
- When problems shift faster than your rate of adaptation you go extinct.
- opportunities is taking the jobs that others don't want.

Be flexible. You need to be able to be a diplomate and a fighter, to speak well among the scholars of academia and the blue collar workers down at the bar.
You need to be comfortable both in a suit and tie and in camouflaged jacket.

Go With the Flow of Change
One of the biggest mistakes that you can make in any endeavor is to stick to rigidly to the old axioms and ways of thinking.
As Bruce Lee said “Be like water”, be willing to change and adapt to the world around you.

# 3.3 - On competing

### On creating imbalances

Create imbalances in your target to create an advantage and raise chances of winning.  
Use methods like [unpredictability](#on-unpredictability), [deceiving](#on-deceiving), [mirroring](#on-mirroring)
and [bait](#on-charming). Some opponents may require special tools.

> *'Keeping your enemies on the defensive and in react mode will have a demoralizing effect on them.'*

> *'If you control the overall direction and framing of the battle, anything they do will play into your hands.'*

HOWEVER... beware of counter-attacking.

> *'The problems created by an audacious move can be disguised, even remedied, by more and greater audacity.'*

> *'Whenever you find yourself on the defensive and in trouble, the greatest danger is the impulse to overreact.'*

<!--
> *'Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake.' -- Napoleon*

- In essence, for a change to occur, you must apply more energy to the system than is extracted by the system.

play to win, not hoping to make it, or why are you doing it? committed to win

24. Use different strategies for different tasks. Attempt easy Tasks as if they were difficult, and difficult as if they were easy. In the one case that confidence may not fall asleep, in the other that it may not be dismayed. -- Balthasar Gracian

2. Make others dependent on you: hope has a good memory, gratitude a bad one. More is to be got from dependence than from courtesy. -- Balthasar Gracian

divide and conquer

> *'Moving first—initiating the attack—will often put you at a disadvantage: you are exposing your strategy and limiting your options.'*

Divide and conquer it.

1. You need to recognize when you're not learning, for one thing. If it's easy, you're not learning. You need to push yourself into the zone of discomfort, where you feel clumsy and have a hard time. Now you're learning.
2. Find a mentor. Lacking that, find e.g. talk of someone explaining some hard techniques and then try to follow the advice. Even and especially if it feels clumsy at first.
3. Switch to a new job where you'll be exposed to new things. try to find a job where people do code review, feedback is how we learn faster.
4. Learn how to learn: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKTxC9pl-WM
5. Reflect on your mistakes, try to find what cues you missed and what you should look for next time. I've been doing this on weekly basis (you can read the results at https://softwareclown.com) and I've learned a huge amount from figuring out underlying cause of what I did wrong.

The metagame is playing a different game than your competitors. A game they can't play.
The metagame is this psychological game that exists among players, involving adjustments – adjustments based on how an opponent is likely to interpret a given set of actions. Better players adjust their strategies and styles to those of particular opponents, always analyzing how the opponents are playing in terms of how the opponents believe they're playing.
Maintaining a well-balanced strategy, while deciphering your opponents' strategies, is the key to the metagame. If you comprehend the concept of the metagame, accurately perceive the flow of your table and then tournament, and stay alerted to and aware of current strategy trends, you'll be able to successfully mix up your play when considering your image and that of your opponents. In return, your game will be highly unpredictable and difficult to read, which should be your ultimate goal.
Part of their greatness comes from identifying the constraints of others and capitalizing on those structural disadvantages.
In any system where there are norms, there are strengths and weaknesses to those norms. If you follow the norms of the system, the results you get are likely to be the norm. When you play a different game, a metagame, you have the opportunity to outperform.

“The most basic idea of strategy is the application of strength against weakness. Or if you prefer, strength applied to the most promising opportunity.
A good strategy doesn’t just draw on existing strength; it creates strength. Rumelt’s definition of strategy as creating strength is particularly important. You don’t deplete yourself as you execute your strategy. You choose tactics that reinforce and build strength as they are deployed.

Geoffrey P. Chamberlain:
A strategy has a single, well defined focus.
A strategy lays out a path to be followed.
A strategy is made up of parts (tactics).
Each of a strategy’s parts pushes towards the defined focus.
A strategy is either intentionally formed or emerges naturally.

According to Rumelt, a strategy must include “premeditation, the anticipation of others’ behavior, and the purposeful design of coordinated actions. As a general rule, strategy is more important in situations where other parties have the potential to thwart or disrupt actions, or where our plans are at risk if we don’t take meaningful steps to achieve them. Good strategy requires us to both focus on a goal, and anticipate obstacles to reaching that goal.  When we encounter obstacles, we may need to employ what Freedman calls “deceits, ruses, feints, manoeuvres and a quicker wit”—our tactics.

Shuai-Jan is a snake that is found in the Ch’ang mountains. Strike at its head, and you will be attacked by its tail; strike at its tail, and you will be attacked by its head; strike at its middle, and you will be attacked by head and tail both.”
— Sun Tzu, The Art of War

Sun Tzu, strategy is about winning before the battle begins, while tactics are about striking at weakness.

### On leverage

Leverage is a force multiplier for your judgement.

> *'Give me a lever long enough, and a place to stand, and I will move the earth.' -- Archimedes*

> *'The greatest shortcoming of the human race is our inability to understand the exponential function.' -- Albert Allen Bartlett*

<!--
on scaling: What works at a small scale (say, a Utopian community), loses its effectiveness as it scales. Everything has a breakpoint.
Their cheating had a small individual effect initially, so it went unnoticed. But the follow-on effect to individual cheating is group cheating, and the utopian goal of To each according to his need, from each according to his ability had the effect of expanding everyone's needs and shrinking their ability, aided by envy and reciprocation effects.

The power of compounding: you can achieve anything, if you stop trying to do everything.

Fortunes require leverage. Business leverage comes from capital, people, and products with no marginal cost of replication (code and media).
Capital means money. To raise money, apply your specific knowledge, with accountability, and show resulting good judgment.
Labor means people working for you. It's the oldest and most fought-over form of leverage. Labor leverage will impress your parents, but don’t waste your life chasing it.
Capital and labor are permissioned leverage. Everyone is chasing capital, but someone has to give it to you. Everyone is trying to lead, but someone has to follow you.
Code and media are permissionless leverage. They're the leverage behind the newly rich. You can create software and media that works for you while you sleep.
An army of robots is freely available - it's just packed in data centers for heat and space efficiency. Use it.
If you can't code, write books and blogs, record videos and podcasts.

Judgement requires experience, but can be built faster by learning foundational skills.
There is no skill called “business.” Avoid business magazines and business classes.
Study microeconomics, game theory, psychology, persuasion, ethics, mathematics, and computers.
Reading is faster than listening. Doing is faster than watching.
You should be too busy to “do coffee" while still keeping an uncluttered calendar.
Set and enforce an aspirational personal hourly rate. If fixing a problem will save less than your hourly rate, ignore it. If outsourcing a task will cost less than your hourly rate, outsource it.
Work as hard as you can. Even though who you work with and what you work on are more important than how hard you work.
Become the best in the world at what you do. Keep redefining what you do until this is true.
There are no get rich quick schemes. That's just someone else getting rich off you.
Apply specific knowledge, with leverage, and eventually you will get what you deserve.
When you're finally wealthy, you'll realize that it wasn't what you were seeking in the first place. But that's for another day.

### On charming

Charm the enemy and find their weaknesses. Then [exploit them](#on-deceiving).

> *'Instead of killing, charm the snake (once there are always more snakes) to fight the other ones. Listen actively and maintain rapport. Know your audience. First they have to [trust](#on-relationships) you. Keep your word and prove your worth, the new guy as always to prove himself.'*

> *'Use selective honesty and generosity to disarm your victim.'  
'Pose as a friend, work as a spy.'  
'Discover each man’s thumbscrew.'  
'Work on the hearts and minds of others.' -- Robert Greene (12th, 14th, 33rd and 43rd law of power)*

> *'People's need for validation and recognition, their need to feel important, is the best kind of weakness to exploit.'*

> *'If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his own language, that goes to his heart.' -- Nelson Mandela*

> *'When you go up in an hierarchy, the need of persuasion is higher.  
To persuade up, focus in interests; to persuade down focus in emotions.'*

Use absence and bait to attract people.

> *'In the long run, the ability to make others come to you is a weapon far more powerful than any tool of aggression.'*

> *'Make other people come to you: use bait if necessary.'  
'Learn to keep people dependent on you.' -- Robert Greene (8th and 11th law of power)*

> *'Bait people into going out on a limb, exposing their weaknesses, then rake them with fire from the side.'*

> *'We attract more flies with honey than vinegar.'*

> *'Stay aloof and people will come to you. It will become a challenge for them to win your affections.'*

> *'Use absence to increase respect and honor.' -- Robert Greene (16th law of power)*

HOWEVER... use absence with [moderation](#on-balance).

> *'If you're always absent, soon you'll not be needed.'*

<!--
- All in all, just keep it simple. Don’t try to complicate the situation. Focus on being yourself, enjoying yourself. If you’re not having a good time, chances are good that people around you aren’t either. Charm is not about trying to pile on a bunch of techniques or manipulating people. It’s actually the complete opposite: letting human nature do its thing.
	
Hooking Curiosity
A screenwriter friend of mine recently told me his secret to writing compelling characters.
“It’s easy,” he said. “Just make them contradictions.”
Becoming a Contradiction
To be human is to be a contradiction
So begin by taking inventory of the various qualities and skills you already have, right now. I recommend doing it in that order -- qualities first (your personality stack), then skills (your talent stack). Write them down. Notice the ways in which you already contradict yourself. Notice how you defy your categories. Trust that these exist in you for a reason. Know that people will gravitate to you because of these qualities. Notice that they already do.

mimicking people gestures and words works!

To Persuade Someone, Look Emotional
- you automatically trust when somebody is doing at that time what you're doing. paraphrased scott adams
- It’s hard to be angry with someone who agrees with you. Making enemies is expensive.

### On deceiving

*'A man is not deceived by others, he deceives himself.' -- Goethe*

If we play by the rules too strictly, if we take them too literally, we are crushed by those around us who are not so foolish.

> *'Appear weak when you are strong and strong when you are weak' -- Sun Tzu*

> *'By seeming stronger than you are, perhaps through an occasional act that is reckless and bold, you can deter the enemy from attacking you.'*

> *'Court attention at all cost.'  
'Play a sucker to catch a sucker: seem dumber than your mark.'  
'Play to people’s fantasies.'  
'Create compelling spectacles.'  
'Stir up waters to catch fish.' -- Robert Greene (6th, 21st, 32nd, 37th and 39th law of power)*

> *'Honesty is a very expensive gift, don't expect it from cheap people.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'The moment a magician says, «Now we begin» you’re already screwed!' -- Brian Brushwood*

> *'I've never fooled anyone. I've let people fool themselves. They didn't bother to find out who and what I was. Instead they would invent a character for me. I wouldn't argue with them. They were obviously loving somebody I wasn't.' --  Marilyn Monroe*

However deceiving is not lying. Disappointment destroys trust.

> *'Lying is like a nuclear bomb. The effects will be there for a long time to you to deal with.'*

> *'The evil that men do lives after them; The good is often interred with their bones.' -- Julius Caesar; Act 3, Scene II*

> *'I'm not upset that you lied to me. I'm upset that from now on I can't believe on you.' -- Nietzsche*

> *'Don't lie to anybody that you are not going to kill. Lying is a bad idea. The lie is going to burn you.' -- hostage negotiator*

> *'One thing I learned at 3 AM: everyone lied to survive. Truth is a luxury we day-people take for granted.' -- James Altucher*

<!--
> *'The underground of the city is like what's underground in people. Beneath the surface, it's boiling with monsters.' -- Guillermo del Toro*
> *'If Socrates was right in saying that no one does wrong knowingly, someone who has caused you grief probably didn’t set out to do it on purpose.'*
> *'Never be mean to anybody that can hurt you by doing nothing.'*

Clean players on shady markets usually don't do well on the long term.

- Bad liars should speak as little as possible.
- if somebody asks for the evidence, normally he is lieing

the good reason (the reason they tell you) and the real reason.

### On unpredictability

> *'Conceal your intention.'  
'Say less than necessary.'  
'Keep others in suspended terror: cultivate an air of unpredictability.'  
'Assume formlessness.' -- Robert Greene (3rd, 4th, 17th and 48th law of power)*

However unpredictability can work against you: if you are in a subordinate position, it reduces [trust]().

<!--
Teach no one your tricks or they will be used against you.
-->

### On mirroring

Mirroring works best when your group is in minority.

> *'Being pacifist in face of wolves is the source of endless tragedy.'*

> *'To change a status quo established by a minority, the majority must unite. To do that use non-violent organized action and humor, keeping the risk as low as possible so everybody can join your side.' -- Srdja Popovic*

> *'Disarm and infuriate with the mirror effect.' -- Robert Greene (44th law of power)*

<!--
reciprocation bias
The archaeologist Richard Leakey believes reciprocation is the foundation on which we have evolved: “We are human because our ancestors learned to share their food and their skills in an honored network of obligation.
social sanctions can be tough on those who fail to cooperate
As with most things, however, reciprocation has a darker side. Just as we tend to reciprocate good behavior, sometimes we also pay back bad deeds. One of the most effective game-theory strategies is tit for tat.
The standard antidote to one’s overactive hostility is to train oneself to defer reaction.
There’s also another way. Because the reciprocation tendency is so extreme, we can reverse the course of events by doing good rather than harm to the other party.
We feel obliged to repay favors we have received. We feel obliged to make a concession to someone who has made a concession to us.
Cialdini moved from rejection to compliance after the boy had moved from a larger to a smaller request.  The remarkable thing, and this is where bias comes in, was that Cialdini was not at all interested in either of the things the boy had offered.

### On opponents

Beware of all players.  
However there are people acting stupid. Easy wins if you can identify them.

> *'Don't attribute to malice what you can attribute to incompetence or busyness.'*

> *'Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the the universe.' -- Albert Einstein*

> *'Show me a hero, and I'll write you a tragedy.' -- F. Scott Fitzgerald*

> *'Fools and wise folk are alike harmless. It is the half-wise and the half-foolish, who are the most dangerous.' -- Goethe*

Easy players are often just [bait](#on-charming).

> *'Despise the free lunch.' -- Robert Greene (40th law of power)*

> *'Sometimes one pays most for the things one gets for nothing.' -- Albert Einstein*

> *'«El dorados» are never drawn in the map.'*

Desperate players will risk anything in a fight. This gives them a huge advantage, they have nothing to lose.

> *'Don’t fight a starving animal. Never contend with a Man who has nothing to Lose; for thereby you enter into an unequal conflict. The other enters without anxiety; having lost everything, including shame, he has no further loss to fear. He therefore re-sorts to all kinds of insolence.' -- Balthasar Gracian*

> *'Beware the fury of a patient man.' -- John Dryden*

> *'Beware of sad people.'*

> *'Our fearlessness shall be our secret weapon.' -- John Green*

 On difficult players, besides outworking them, you'll need all weaponry. Sometimes even the «dirty stuff»: «pawn sacrifices», bribes and lying are examples of «dirty stuff». They can be effective but use them only on desperate situations: it's a scar for life.

> *'Put all the meat in the barbecue.' -- Jorge Jesus (soccer coach)*

> *'Do I not destroy my enemies when I make them my friends?' --  Abraham Lincoln*

> *'It’s hard to beat a person who never gives up.' -- Babe Ruth*

> *'Get others to do the work for you, but always take the credit.'  
'Keep your hands clean.' -- Robert Greene (7th and 26th law of power)*

When nothing else works, [surrender](#on-surrendering). Only use anger and go all in if you can see the end already.

<!--
- Use anger only as a tool, when you need it to improve your situation.
- no one will help you in a way that’s prejudicial to them.
- People are amazing optimizers, and will find any loopholes or gaps that allow them to use any system to their advantage.
- Nietszche says to measure one's strength by the number of parasites one can support.
- surpass a gatekeeper: i'm x, i know your situation and how is the way i can make it the most confortable (safe) for you.

### On defeating status quo

The only successful changes are those coming from within.

> *'To successfully change a status quo maintained by a minority you only need to unite the majority. How?  
Make a non-violent revolution: low risk will make more people to participate.' -- Srdja Popovic*

<!--
burocracy prevents low probability events to happen at the expense of making more systems that the other people must comply and that take happiness from them.

# 3.4 - On ending

### On finishing

Starting is fun but success belongs to finishers.  
[Going halfway](#on-focus-time-management-and-productivity) is too expensive to do it often.

> *'Don't take a half step where a full step is required.'*

> *'Crush your enemy totally.' -- Robert Greene (15th law of power)*

> *'If you’re going to try, go all the way. Otherwise, don’t even start.' -- Charles Bukowski*

> *'Ultimately the only peace and security you can hope for from your enemies is their disappearance.'*

> *'Only put off until tomorrow what you are willing to die having left undone.' -- Pablo Picasso*

> *'When the end finally comes, it comes quickly.'*

> *'The war will be ended by the exhaustion of nations rather than the victories of armies.' -- Winston Churchill*

> *'You finished ahead of time, that means you forgot something.'*

> *'Difficulties increase the nearer we come to our aim.' -- Goethe*

### On surrendering

*'It only hurts when you don't have time to prepare for the fall' -- Tony Hawk (skater)*

Use this opportunity to re-create yourself. In order to come back you have to go away. If you didnt quit anything you woud be still playing with toddlers.  
Sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together. Every story has an end, but in life every end is just a new beginning.

> *'Surrender conceals great power: lulling the enemy into complacency, it give you time to recoup, time to undermine, time for revenge.'*

> *'Use the surrender tactic: transform weakness into power.'  
'Re-create yourself.' -- Robert Greene (22nd and 25th law of power)*

> *'Close some doors today. Not because of pride, incapacity or arrogance, but simply because they lead you nowhere.' -- Paul Coelho*

> *'Once the game is over, the king and the pawn go back in the same box.' -- Italian proverb*

> *'The greatest revenge is success.' -- Frank Sinatra*

<!--
> *'Waiting is painful. Forgetting is painful. But not knowing which to do is the worst kind of suffering.' -- Paulo Coelho*
-->




---
### On forgiveness

*'The only way out of the labyrinth of suffering is to forgive.' -- John Green*

If forgiveness is a process of release — of letting go of something — then the opposite of forgiveness is a decision to hold onto something.
Many people think that the alternative to forgiveness is punishment: e either choose to forgive someone for what they’ve done, or we return the favor with some sort of retribution. But punishment isn’t really the opposite of forgiveness. After all, we can punish someone without forgiving them, or punish them in order to forgive them. People do this all the time. Governments do it every day.

By refusing to forgive someone, we get to cast ourselves as victims, as underdogs, as injured parties. Most important, we get to preserve our status in the conflict — usually, as the person who’s “right.” In reality, we only keep the suffering alive for ourselves. We are the ones we end up punishing.

> *'Dumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right.' -- J.K. Rowling*

> *'Life has become immeasurably better since I have been forced to stop taking it seriously.' -- Hunter S. Thompson*

### On winning

*'Maintain reserves. A man should not employ all his capacity and power at once and on every occasion. Even in knowledge there should be a rearguard, so that your resources are doubled. One must always have something to resort to when there is fear of a defeat.' -- Balthasar Gracian*

It's not just about winning. The way you win sets you up for the next round.

> *'Win through your actions, never through argument.'  
'Make your accomplishments seem effortless.' -- Robert Greene (9th and 30th law of power)*

> *'You only find out who is swimming naked when the tide goes out.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'All endings are also beginnings. We just don’t know it at the time.' --  Mitch Albom*

> *'The destination is not the end of the road; it's just a stop along the way. An intersection to take you to your next destination.'*

> *'Winning isn’t everything, but wanting to win is.' -- Vince Lombardi*

> *'You might be winning but you’re not growing, and growing might be the most important form of winning.' -- Jordan Peterson*

tecnically win or fundamentally win

winning by exhaustion: Traditional military theorists such as Sun Tzu (“Supreme excellence consists of breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting”) and Machiavelli (“Never attempt to win by force what can be won by deception”) evangelized for clever tactics. These methods tend to result in far fewer casualties, waste fewer resources and are a display of superior intellect, rather than just strength. Attrition warfare is usually a last resort only. And most of the time when you win, it's only temporary. By not scoring a decisive blow, the winners leave room for the losers to believe they can win the next time. From the start, the Battle of Verdun was fought upon a foundation of attrition. Both sides were essentially trapped, with no option but to keep trying to force the other into submission. Both sides were using similar approaches with similar capabilities. The concept of attrition applies outside of war. Bureaucracies grind people out. Excessive competition among businesses might be good for consumers, but it's a grind for the companies involved. History shows that the way out of trench warfare is the use of asymmetric weaponry. If you're using basically the same strategy with basically the same resources as your competitor, you're in a war of attrition.
