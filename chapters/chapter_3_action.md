# 3.1 - On preparing action

### On creativity, vision and ideas

We don’t have an «imagination» we have a memory. Creative minds are rarely tidy.

> *'Those who do not want to imitate anything, produce nothing.' -- Salvador Dali*

> *'The new is the forgotten because everything has already happened.' -- Arturo Pérez Reverte*

> *'The secret to creativity is knowing how to hide your sources.' -- Albert Einstein*

> *'Good artists copy; great artists steal.' -- Steve Jobs & others*

> *'To invent, you need a good imagination and a pile of junk.' -- Thomas Edison*

Creativity is a muscle - you have to practice it every day.  
Once it stays the same, it's no longer creative. [Without new experiences, your soul rots](chapter_1_self.md#on-comfort-and-risk).

> *'Good ideas are a numbers game. You need a lot of bad ones to get one good.'*

> *'We can’t solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them.'*

How to find ideas?  
Creativity is born out of free time, play and boredom lead to creativity.

> *'If you accept conventional wisdom from conventional people living conventional lives. Can you expect to be anything other than conventional?'*

> *'Ideas by themselves are roughly worthless. There's no market for them. There's no place where one can go and buy an idea. Describing your idea in detail doesn't mean other people will copy it. First they'll have to be convinced it's a good idea. If you ever tried to change anyone else's mind you know by now how hard that is. Not even founders themselves can predict how well their own ideas will do. And even if people are convinced your idea is a good idea, they'll still have to compare it to the existing idea they are already working on and see which one they're more likely to do well with.'*

> *'Far better an approximate answer to the right question, which is often vague, than an exact answer to the wrong question, which can always be made precise.' -- John Tukey*

> *'Ignorance is a bliss, gives you freedom to think about stuff. being ignorant about the market and the «right way» to do things allows them to come up with creative solutions to problems that experienced veterans would never have thought of. Do not see your ignorance as a curse, see it as a blessing.'*

> *'The secret to doing good research is always to be a little underemployed. You waste years by not being able to waste hours.' -- Amos Tversky*

> *'I cultivate empty space as a way of life for the creative process.' -- Josh Waitzkin*

> *'Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn't really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while.'*

> *'Finding a good idea: idea sex, mix stuff.'*

How to judge ideas?

> *'Peers (fellow creators) are the best judging ideas. Managers are the worse because they are outcome attached: they will regret more a false positive than a false negative.'*

> *'Ideas are not worth a damn thing. Only execution is. Forget all of your ideas. Instead, worry about transforming yourself into the kind of person who can execute and bring ideas to life.'*

Creativity is linked to autonomy.

> *'Creativity and critical thinking:  
In subordinate position it gets you labelled a dreamer, a weirdo, or an idiot.  
In executive position, visionary, maverick, multidisciplinary thinker, etc.  
You can only truly creative in a position with autonomy, so you either climb the ladder or start your own thing.'*

<!--
The mind that opens to a new idea never returns to its original size. -- Albert Einstein

Play is a gateway to possibility. Einstein called play the essential feature of productive thought. Seneca was also a fan of combinatorial play.

> *'Moments of originality and moments of conformity.'*
-->

### On analysis

Analysis is an art, not a science.

> *'To find deep truths intuition is better than statistics.'*

> *'Statistics are like bikinis. What they reveal is suggestive, but what they conceal is vital.' -- Levenstein*

> *'«Dictator's dilemma»: when the vote goes 79% – 21% for some candidate we presume it was fair and represents a popular mandate. But when his excellency and Great Father of his People, gets 97% of the vote we say that is BS.'*

And, as such, error-prone:  
a) randomness: most facts are a «tell» but some are just random.

> *'Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.' -- Sigmund Freud*

> *'Never assume that what people say or do in a particular moment is a statement of their permanent desires.'*

> *'Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts.' -- ALbert Einstein*

It is possible to view this as an isolated event or a trend

c) [being deceived](#on-deceiveness);

> *'Don't tell me what you value. Show me your budget, and I'll tell you what you value.' -- Joe Biden quoting his father*

b) and specially, bias, will trigger miscalculations.

> *'What Susie says of Sally says mores about Susie than of Sally.'*

> *'Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth.'*

> *'The hardest thing to explain is the glaringly evident that everyone has decided not to see.' -- Ayn Rand*

> *'Each generation imagines itself to be more intelligent than the one that went before it, and wiser than the one that comes after it.' -- Orwell*

> *'Experiment and theory often show remarkable agreement when performed in the same laboratory' -- Daniel Bershader*

> *'Have you ever noticed that anybody driving slower than you is an idiot, and anyone going faster than you is a maniac?' -- George Carlin*

One of the great problems with filters is our human tendency to think that what we see is all there is, without realizing that what we see is being filtered.

Be specially careful when facing new ideas.  
Too much info is also prone to bias: you'll always find confirmation to your pre-existing beliefs.

> *'Nothing is as simple at seems at first, or as hopeless as it seems in the middle, or as finished as it seems in the end.'*

> *'I am both worse and better than you thought.' -- Sylvia Plath*

> *'You always get exaggerated notions of things you don’t know anything about.' -- Albert Camus*

> *'An unfamiliar city is a fine thing. That’s the time and place when you can suppose that all of the people you meet are nice.' -- Louis Céline*

HINTS:

> *'«Chekov bottle»: If something is described in a previous chapter, it means it will be important for the action in a future chapter.'*

> *'Pay attention to negative cues: what should have happened but did not.'*

> *'Look for something that doesn't make sense. That's where the gold mine is:  
«It doesn't make sense, the price is going down!». The world makes sense, just not the model. Some X factor is hidden.'  
'Don't try to make sense of the world. It's too complicated. Instead watch investors attempting to make sense of it. They're the ones that will make the assets price move.'  
'look for the obvious: «Do you want to be a writer? You should have something to say.»'  
'The most important question: «What do you need to see to change your view?»' -- Adam Robinson (paraphrased)*

### On planning and decision making

Plan ahead and prepare for the highly probable scenarios.  
Make the decisions right now. When in the moment of making the decision, you have already done it.

> *'Plan all the way to the end.' -- Robert Greene (29th law of power)*

> *'All battles are won or lost before they are ever fought.' -- Sun Tzu*

> *'The best way to predict the future is to invent it.' -- Alan Kay*

> *'If I had 9 hours to chop down a tree, I'd spend the first six sharpening my ax.' -- Abraham Lincoln*

> *'The script is going to be bad but in the end we'll finish eating pizza.'*

> *'I am not a product of my circumstances. I am a product of my decisions.' -- Stephen Cove*

> *'You have choices. Choices are experiments.'*

> *'Decisions are made based on memory. There are 3 routes: reflex (genetics), habits or goals. Influence their memories and you can influence their decisions.'*

<!--

“Hard decisions are only hard when you’re in the process of making them.” -- Debbie Millman

D: Define the problem simply.
A: Assess the impact.
N: Name the underlying dynamic.
C: Create the smallest next step you can.
E: Establish personal accountability.

Always assume that you’re wrong from a purely philosophical point of view. We are always wrong about whatever we believe. Knowledge is always moving forward, and if you think about things you used to believe 10 years ago or five years ago, it embarrasses you now. And the things that you hold dear and hold to be true today are likely going to embarrass you in 10 or 20 years from now. 

Say no to things you aren’t really excited about doing. Hell yes or no. The mediocre robs you of the great. sivers 

Make decisions about what you want to do ideally on the front end rather than tracking what you do on the back end. Planning a diet vs. recording a diet. Making decisions under stress vs making decisions when relaxed and clear headed.

we think we make choices but our choices are affected by others. (ex of naming a child)
people pick what is familiar. people are influenced without us realizing.
working class want to feel the same as others.
white collar want to feel different from others.

decisions are tainted by the emotional investments you accumulate, and the more you invest in something the harder it becomes to abandon it.

inoculate yourself from the stress of making hard decisions when you need to. -- Allen Tucker

Clarity is the Key to All Success: without a clear roadmap for who we are and what we want to achieve, we will never find true success.
You must know exactly what you want, when you want it, and why you want it.
Without this clarity, you will find yourself wandering aimlessly for years, or even decades of your life and looking back, wishing that you’d had more direction.

How to plan: start with a [vision](#on-creativity-vision-and-ideas).

> *'Choose the plan with more options. The one that lets you change plan.'*

> *'Hell yes or no.' -- Derek Sivers*

> *'My brother says to never make a big decision before you take a shower.'*

Decide in advance what your time is worth. Do not let others tell you how much you will be paid. They may make offers, but it is never their decision. It is yours.

# 3.2 - On executing

### On starting and timing

Just start.  
Stop making resolutions and start making something.

> *'You don't have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great.' -- Zig Ziglar*

> *'The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step' -- Lao Tzu*

> *'A year from now, you will wish you had started today.' -- Karen Lamb*

> *'Waiting for troubles to come to you will only multiply them and give them a deadly momentum.'*

> *'If everybody contemplates the infinite instead of fixing the drains, many of us will die of cholera.' -- John Rich*

Why people procrastinate?

1. lack of urgency / deadlines (the panic monster)
No inspiration or opportunities - the inspiration you are waiting for, in order to start, is on the other side of starting. Momentum generates motivation.

> *'If opportunity doesn't knock, build a door.' -- Milton Berle*

> *'Pressed by circumstances, we feel unusually energized and focused.'*

No preparation - you can learn while you do it.  

> *'Go and do the things you can’t. That is how you get to do them.' -- Pablo Picasso*

> *'Just jump in and figure it out. It can’t be that hard.' -- Chris Voss*

2. perfectionism

> *'Perfectionism doesn’t make you feel perfect; it makes you feel inadequate.' -- Maria Shriver*

> *'The important work of moving the world forward does not wait to be done by perfect men.' -- George Eliot*

3. fear (of change)

> *'We distract ourselves because we are not willing to face up with what bothers us.'*

> *'When hope disappears, so does action'*

> *'What gets measured gets done.'*

<!--
We feel anxiety over a deadline or a task that we don’t want to do, even though we know we should. So we procrastinate in order to remove that anxiety.

Time is the most precious thing you own.

– Have a Mission
Every day, whether it’s “be creative today.” Or “go some place you’ve never been” or “talk to ten random strangers”, make a mission.
Learn something new.
Missions are for people who DO. Mission statements are for people who DON’T.

1. Don’t overthink it. Don’t waste time analyzing it.

> *'Do not wait to strike till the iron is hot; but make it hot by striking.' -- Yeats*
-->

Timing is important.

> *'Enter action with boldness.'*

'Master the art of timing' -- Robert Greene (28th and 35th law of power)*

However don't wait for the [perfect occasion](), a good occasion is a safer bet.  
You will languish if you stop for a long time. Paralysis is worse than bad timing.

> *'The best thing you can do is the right thing, the second best thing is the wrong thing, and the worst thing you can do is nothing.' -- Winston Churchill*

> *'The world doesn’t have the luxury of waiting for complete answers before it takes action.' -- Daniel Gilber*

> *'Did you know you can't steer a boat that isn't moving? Just like a life.' -- Paul Lutus*

HOWEVER, have a [plan](#on-planning). Any plan will do it.

> *'No one ever wrote a plan to be fat lazy or stupid. That’s what happens when you don’t have a plan.' – Larry Winget*

> *'If you are unsure of a course of action, do not attempt it. Your doubts and hesitations will infect your execution.'*

> *'Once you step into a fight that is not of your own choosing, you lose all initiative.'*

### On pace, position and direction

Direction is more important than pace.

> *'Speed is useful only if you are running in the right direction.' -- Joel Barker*

> *'Moving in a direction opposite to what we are doing right now where we are not successful will guarantee success.'*

> *'When you run, make sure you run to something and not away from.' -- The Avett Brothers*

Don’t be afraid to take time away to find it. 

> *'Only fools rush into a situation. By committing too quickly you lose your maneuverability.'*

Don't be thirsty.

> *'No matter how great the talent or efforts, some things just take time. You can’t produce a baby in one month by getting nine women pregnant.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'You finished ahead of time, that means you forgot something.'*

> *'Vai procurar, vai achar o que não tinha perdido.'*

> *'Who seeks shall find.' -- Sophocles*

> *'Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.' -- Albert Einstein*

'Position yourself for victory.'

> *'Start as close to the end as possible.' -- Kurt Vonnegu*

> *'Convenience (location) is better than space amount.'*

> *'Trade space for time.'*

### On focus and time management

Time itself, is not your limitation. Attention is.  
You’re not managing time, you're managing attention.

> *'Do things in batch all at once. Interruption and switching between tasks costs too much.'*

> *'Any media company harvest your attention and transform it into revenue.'*

> *'Busy imply out of control. lack of time is lack of priorities.'*

First the essential. Then the details.

> *'Concentrate your forces.'  
'Strike the shepherd and the sheep will scatter.' -- Robert Greene (23rd and 42nd law of power)*

> *'In a divided world, power will come from keeping your own group united and cohesive.'*

> *'You can do anything, but not everything.' -- David Allen*

> *'Focusing is about saying no.' -- Steve Jobs*

> *'When life gets blurry, just adjust your focus.'*

> *'It's not what you read, it's what you ignore.' -- Scott Hanselman*

> *'A man with a watch knows what time it is. A man with two watches is never sure.'*

> *'I cannot give you the formula for success, but I can give you the formula for failure, which is: try to please everybody.' -- Herbert Swope*

> *'I want to know God's thoughts; the rest are details.' -- Albert Einstein*

> *'You only have to do a very few things right in your life so long as you don't do too many things wrong.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'Always look where you want to go, not where you don't want to go.'*

> *'Anything that does not bring me alive is too small for me.' -- David Whyte*

HINTS:

> *'working by layers: functional -> perfect'*

> *'Tackle your most important thing (MIT) first thing in the morning.'*

> *'Track your time manually so you have to see it and deal with it. Use a spreadsheet or paper.'*

> *'Focus. Do one thing really well. Solve one problem with one solution.  
Focus on the one thing most likely to get maximum results. Forget everything else.'*

> *'Reduce decision making on small tasks to a minimum and do it quickly and in bulk: what to wear, what to eat, etc.'*

> *'Don't major on minor things.'*

HOWEVER...

4. Focus on Revenue Generating Activities
One of the simplest habits that you can start implementing today is to shift all of your focus towards revenue generating activities.
Plain and simple, if it is not going to earn you money, then don’t do it. Focus only on the activities that are going to push the envelope forward for you and your company and result in an influx of cash.
If there are tasks that need to be done that do not directly result in the generation of revenue, then outsource them so that you have more time to work on building your cash flow.

try to hit 10% of your followers instead of trying to hit all of them at the same time.

if you are the focus you will be assumed as being the the cause.

And too many decisions will drain you. Attention is the most limited resource.

make the basics in life, and you're good to go. you don't need to optimise.

1. Learn to Focus on What You Are Doing Now- be fully present
The more present and focused you can be in one area, the more focus and presence you will be able to bring to the other areas of your life.

### On control

Control what you can. Ignore what you can't.

> *'You can lead a horse to water but you can’t make him drink.'*

> *'You can only control yourself. Control what you’re primed by, who you are around, the ideas and problems you focus on. Power comes from that. '*

> *'You want everything to stay the same until you’re ready for it to change. But you can’t do that. You can’t expect the whole world to stand still until you’re ready.' -- Gayle Friesen*

> *'Disdain things you cannot have: ignoring them is the best revenge.' -- Robert Greene (36th law of power)*

> *'If you change the way you look at things, the thing you look at change' -- Dr. Wayne Dyer*

HOWEVER...

> *'If things seem under control, you're just not going fast enough.' -- Mario Andretti*

> *'One’s real life is often the life that one does not lead.' -- Oscar Wilde*

<!--
past and future doesn't exist. we cannot control anything, at most we can influenciate something.

### On balance

Life is a balancing act.

The dose makes the poison: things in excess become their opposite.  
The hardest skill is knowing when to stop.

> *'Do not go past the mark you aimed for; in victory, learn when to stop.' -- Robert Greene (47th law of power)*

> *'The hardest skill is knowing what could be simplified, and what's good enough.'*

> *'Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.'*

> *'If half of the room laughs and half doesn't is a success.'*

> *'A balance sheet must balance.'*

> *'Most things are not binary.'*

> *'Balance is not about spending the same amount of time focused on every area of your life either. It's about making progress in all areas of your life and ensuring that you improve just a little bit each day in your health, wealth, relationships, and personal growth.'*

Diversification solves a lot of problems.

> *'Don’t try to make your job your whole life. Don’t try to make your art your sole income.'*

How to balance an imbalance? Overcompensate.

> *'Overcompensate to make it balanced.' -- Derek Sivers*

> *'Some people get passion from something they struggled with.'*



---
### On adapting

Plans are not static. Adapt not react.  
You need to switch strategies a few times to get where you want to go.

> *'I am a man of fixed and unbending principles, the first of which is to be flexible at all times.' -- Everett Dirksen*

> *'Life is more like tetris than chess.'*

> *'One should not be too straightforward. Go & see the forest. The straight trees are cut down, the crooked ones are left standing.' -- Kautilya*

> *'The most important thing to do if you find yourself in a hole is to stop digging.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'What got you here won't get you there.'*

> *'The directions to get you anywhere include a few turns:  
Sometimes you need to say YES to everything and be open to growth;  
Sometimes you need to say NO to everything and focus.  
It's scary to make those direction choices, but that's how I know I'm on to something. Fear is a great road sign.'  
-- Derek Sivers (paraphrased)*

> *'When the winds of change blow, some people build walls while others build windmills.' -- Chinese proverb*

> *'However beautiful the strategy, you should occasionally look at the results.' -- Winston Churchill*

> *'Whatever space and time mean, place and occasion mean more.' -- Aldo van Eyck*

> *'If I don’t have red, I use blue.' -- Pablo Picasso*

HINT: Willpower is finite. So there are limits on change. Change requires attention.

HOWEVER...

> *'Preach the need for change, but never reform too much at once.' -- Robert Greene (45th law of power)*

<!--


stick to the plan. poople sabotage their one plans when it get tedious, nobnotusos, challegnig or too difficult. people think they need a new plan.

Be flexible. You need to be able to be a diplomate and a fighter, to speak well among the scholars of academia and the blue collar workers down at the bar.
You need to be comfortable both in a suit and tie and in camouflaged jacket.

Go With the Flow of Change
One of the biggest mistakes that you can make in any endeavor is to stick to rigidly to the old axioms and ways of thinking.
As Bruce Lee said “Be like water”, be willing to change and adapt to the world around you.

Charm the enemy and find their weaknesses. Then [exploit them](#on-deceiving).

> *'Instead of killing, charm the snake (once there are always more snakes) to fight the other ones. Listen actively and maintain rapport. Know your audience. First they have to [trust](#on-trust) you. Keep your word and prove your worth, the new guy as always to prove himself.'*

> *'Use selective honesty and generosity to disarm your victim.'  
'Pose as a friend, work as a spy.'  
'Discover each man’s thumbscrew.'  
'Work on the hearts and minds of others.' -- Robert Greene (12th, 14th, 33rd and 43rd law of power)*

> *'When you go up in an hierarchy, the need of persuasion is higher.  
To persuade up, focus in interests; to persuade down focus in emotions.'*

'Say less than necessary.'  
'Keep others in suspended terror: cultivate an air of unpredictability.'  
'Assume formlessness.' -- Robert Greene (3rd, 4th, 17th and 48th law of power)*

HOWEVER... unpredictability can work against you: if you are in a subordinate position, it reduces trust.

### On mirroring

Mirroring works best when your group is in minority.

> *'Being pacifist in face of wolves is the source of endless tragedy.'*

> *'To change a status quo based on a minority, the majority must unite. To do that use non-violent organized action and humor, keeping the risk as low as possible so everybody can join your side.' -- Srdja Popovic*

> *'Disarm and infuriate with the mirror effect.' -- Robert Greene (44th law of power)*

### On opponents

1) Beware of easy opponents. Most times it's [bait](#on-charming).

> *'Despise the free lunch.' -- Robert Greene (40th law of power)*

> *'Sometimes one pays most for the things one gets for nothing.' -- Albert Einstein*

> *«El dorados» are never drawn in the map.'*

And desperate opponents will risk anything in a fight. This gives them a huge advantage, they have nothing to lose.

> *'Beware the fury of a patient man.' -- John Dryden*

> *'Use anger only as a tool, when you need it to improve your situation.'*

> *'Beware of sad people.'*

> *'Our fearlessness shall be our secret weapon.' -- John Green* 

HOWEVER... there are same people acting stupid. Easy wins if you can identify them.

> *'Don't attribute to malice what you can attribute to incompetence or busyness.'*

> *'In the course of your life you will be continually encountering fools. There are simply too many to avoid.'*

> *'Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the the universe.' -- Albert Einstein*

2) On difficult opponents, to win, besides outworking them, you'll need all weaponry.

> *'Put all the meat in the barbecue.' -- Portuguese soccer coach*

Even the «dirty stuff»: «pawn sacrifices», bribes and lying are examples of «dirty stuff».  
They can be effective but use them *only* on life changing situations: it's a scar for life.

> *'Get others to do the work for you, but always take the credit.'  
'Keep your hands clean.' -- Robert Greene (7th and 26th law of power)*

When nothing else works, [surrender](#on-surrendering). Only use anger and go [all in](#on-desperate-opponents) if you can see the end already.

### On defeating status quo

The only successful changes are those coming from within.

> *'To successfully change a status quo maintained by a minority you only need to unite the majority. How?  
Make a non-violent revolution: low risk will make more people to participate.' -- Srdja Popovic*

burocracy prevents low probability events to happen at the expense of making more systems that the other people must comply and that take happyness from them.

# 3.4 - On ending

### On finishing

Finish it. [Going halfway](#on-focus) is too expensive to do it often.

> *'Don't take a half step where a full step is required.'*

> *'Crush your enemy totally.' -- Robert Greene (15th law of power)*

> *'Ultimately the only peace and security you can hope for from your enemies is their disappearance.'*

> *'Only put off until tomorrow what you are willing to die having left undone.' -- Pablo Picasso*

> *'When the end finally comes, it comes quickly.'*

### On winning

It's not just about winning. The way you win sets you up for the next round.

> *'Win through your actions, never through argument.'  
'Make your accomplishments seem effortless.' -- Robert Greene (9th and 30th law of power)*

> *'You only find out who is swimming naked when the tide goes out.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'All endings are also beginnings. We just don’t know it at the time.' --  Mitch Albom*

> *'The destination is not the end of the road; it's just a stop along the way. An intersection to take you to your next destination.'*

> *'Winning isn’t everything, but wanting to win is.' -- Vince Lombardi*

<!--
tecnically win or fundamentally win

winning by exhaustion
Traditional military theorists such as Sun Tzu (“Supreme excellence consists of breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting”) and Machiavelli (“Never attempt to win by force what can be won by deception”) evangelized for clever tactics. These methods tend to result in far fewer casualties, waste fewer resources and are a display of superior intellect, rather than just strength.

Attrition warfare is usually a last resort only. And most of the time when you win, it's only temporary. By not scoring a decisive blow, the winners leave room for the losers to believe they can win the next time.

“The war will be ended by the exhaustion of nations rather than the victories of armies.” -- Winston Churchill

From the start, the Battle of Verdun was fought upon a foundation of attrition. Both sides were essentially trapped, with no option but to keep trying to force the other into submission. Both sides were using similar approaches with similar capabilities.

The concept of attrition applies outside of war. Bureaucracies grind people out. Excessive competition among businesses might be good for consumers, but it's a grind for the companies involved.

History shows that the way out of trench warfare is the use of asymmetric weaponry. If you're using basically the same strategy with basically the same resources as your competitor, you're in a war of attrition.

### On surrendering

Use this opportunity to re-create yourself.  
'It only hurts when you don't have time to prepare for the fall' -- Tony Hawk

> *'Surrender conceals great power: lulling the enemy into complacency, it give you time to recoup, time to undermine, time for revenge.'*

> *'Use the surrender tactic: transform weakness into power.'  
'Re-create yourself.' -- Robert Greene (22nd and 25th law of power)*

> *'The greatest revenge is success.' -- Frank Sinatra*
