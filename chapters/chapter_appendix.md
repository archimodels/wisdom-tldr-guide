# Appendix A - Time

### On past and memory

You are your memory but *let go* your past [failures](#on-mistakes-and-failure).  
They are meant to guide you, not to define you or determine your future.

> *'Half of the game is learning how to forget events in the past that eat away at you and cloud your reason.'*

> *'He'd wasted most of his life thinking he'd wasted most of his life'*

> *'Never regret something that once made you smile.'*

> *'Stop looking for happiness in the same place where you lost it.'*

> *'You can't start the next chapter of your life if you keep re-reading the last one.'*

> *'I don’t know any longer whether I’m living or remembering.' -- Albert Camus*

How memory works? People forget by decaying and giving them other stuff to remember.

> *'People forget future events more than past events.'*

> *'People remember more the beginning and the end of something.'*

> *'Repetition is good for memory but its a thin line between repetition and getting annoyed.'* 

<!--
I’m like that. Either I forget right away or I never forget.

> *'Memory is never a precise duplicate of the original; instead, it is a continuing act of creation.'*

The people who struggle most are the ones who can’t accept the incessant unfairness of life. They become so consumed with what should have happened, the way other people should have behaved that they become incapable of dealing with reality.

> *'Collective memory is more about the present than the past because it is integral to how the group sees itself.' -- Margaret MacMillan*
-->

### On present

You will die soon.  
Act accordingly and don't postpone joy: live life ready to meet god like it’s everyone else’s last day.  
If you can’t find pleasure in the simple or the mundane, then you won’t find pleasure anywhere.

> *'Every day in the mirror I watch death at work.' -- Jean Cocteau*

> *'We are like butterflies who flutter for a day and think it's forever.'*

> *'Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.' -- Mahatma Gandhi*

> *'You’ll miss the best things if you keep your eyes shut.' -- Dr. Seuss*

> *'Never get so busy making a living that you forget to make a life.'*

> *'As you walk and eat and travel be where you are. Otherwise you will miss most of your life.' -- Siddhartha Guatama*

> *'Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.' -- Steve Jobs*

HINTS:

100 blocks a day -- wait but why  
life is long enough

HOWEVER:

> *'Live not in dreams but in contemplation of a reality that is perhaps the future.' -- Rainer Rilke*

<!--
Men are living their whole lives in pursuit of some arbitrary goal that somehow gives them permission to live their lives, love themselves, and enjoy their time on this planet. And frankly, it’s complete bullshit! Life happens in the now.
Money is nothing more than a magnifying glass. Money simply makes you more of what you already are.
They start by focusing on their goals instead of themselves. They are more than willing to hustle and grind on their business for hours on end, but spending an hour in the gym? Not a chance!

> *'Just because you use your eyes, doesn’t mean you see what’s actually there.' -- Murray Carter*

> *'If you are waiting for anything in order to live and love without holding back, then you suffer.' -- David Deida*

We are all made of time and we keep wasting each other..

But just because you are not where you want to be, does not mean that you cannot have fulfillment and joy in the present moment.
Learn to reframe your current situation and find meaning within it.

Time never has, and never will solve a damn thing.

1) Protect Your Time Like Your Money. the day will always pass, spend your time like money
2) Manage Emotions To Better Manage Time: It’s your beliefs that create your feelings, not reality.
Men are disturbed, not by things, but by the principles and notions which they form concerning things. -- Epictetus
procrastination is a mood-management technique
3) Important Beats Urgent
You do what’s easy or urgent, not what really moves the needle.
Since the vast majority of our words and actions are unnecessary, corralling them will create an abundance of leisure and tranquility. As a result, we shouldn’t forget at each moment to ask, is this one of the unnecessary things?
Getting a lot of unnecessary things done is not productivity; it’s stupidity.
Doing something well does not make it important. I think this is one of the most common problems with a lot of time-management or productivity advice; they focus on how to do things quickly. The vast majority of things that people do quickly should not be done at all. -- tim ferriss
4) Focus On Effort, Not Outcome
What’s that have to do with productivity? Plenty. Because you worry about all kinds of stuff that you can’t do anything about. And that’s wasted time and energy.
And neuroscience research shows that by focusing on what you have control over, you decrease stress.
You can’t control whether it ends up as a “robbery” or an “attempted robbery”, just focus on executing the heist in a way that would make mom proud.
No offense to Karl. He did a survey. So he didn’t necessarily get the right answer, he got the most common answer.

I’m with Seneca. Life doesn’t have to be short. We all have 24h in a day. Every single one of us.
You can use them to create something awesome, to visit that someone special who misses you desperately, to provide for your family, or to savor a great moment. But don’t waste your hours. Don’t end up wondering, “What have I been doing with my time?” Leave a trail of accomplishments or smiles behind you.

When we listen to the regrets of the elderly and dying, they invariably lament on what they neglected to do, not what they did.

### On future

Dream big. If your dreams don't scare you, they are not big enough.

> *'Un uomo che vive di ricordi, diventa vecchio. Uno che vive di progetti resta giovane.' -- Bruno Munari*

> *'Anomalies often represent the future but to our eyes they seem strange.'*

> *'The greatest risk to a man is not that he aims too high and misses, but that he aims too low and hits.'*

> *'Anyone who lives within their means suffers from a lack of imagination.' -- Oscar Wilde*

> *'Life is understood backwards, but must be lived forwards.' -- Kierkegaard*

> *'You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.' -- Steve Jobs*

# Appendix B - On envy triggers

### On intelligence and talent

'In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts; they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty.' -- Ralph Waldo Emerson

'Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent. It takes a touch of genius, and a lot of courage, to move in the opposite direction.' -- Ernst F. Schumacher

Genius and talent are rare, and as such, the most sensitive trigger for envy.

HINT: talent is fragile. To reveal the true nature of your intelligence rarely pays; you should get in the habit of downplaying it at all times.

> *'I think we have an ideology about talent that says that talent is a tangible, resilient, hardened, shiny thing. It will always rise to the top. To find and encourage talent, all you have to do as a society, is to make sure the right doors are open. Free campus visits, free tuition, letters to the kids with high score. You raise your hand and say, «over here!» and the talent will come running, but that's not true. It’s not resilient and shiny, talent is really, really fragile.' -- Malcolm Gladwell*

<!--
So many geniuses, are really good at eliminating unnecessary complexity. Enstien, for instance, was a master at sifting the essential from the non-essential. Steve Jobs was the same.

“Most geniuses—especially those who lead others—prosper not by deconstructing intricate complexities but by exploiting unrecognized simplicities.”
— Andy Benoit

> *'The true test of intelligence is not how much we know how to do, but how to behave when we don’t know what to do.' -- John Holt*
-->




---
### On wealth

Being rich is being fulfilled, not counting money all day.

> *'Life, is not a having and a getting, but a being and a becoming.' -- Myrna Loy*

> *'Shift your focus from achievement to fulfillment:  
What makes you come alive, what do you enjoy doing, who do you enjoy being around?'*

> *'Some people are so poor, all they have is money.' -- Patrick Meagher*

> *'It's nice to have a lot of money, but you know, you don't want to keep it around forever. I prefer buying things. Otherwise, it's a little like saving sex for your old age.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'You can spend your time making money but you can't spend your money making time.'*

> *'You’re not supposed to optimize for money; you’re supposed to optimize for happiness.' -- Mr. Money Mustache*

> *'Don’t think money does everything or you are going to end up doing everything for money.' -- Voltaire*

> *'We don't make movies to make money; We make money to make more movies.' -- Walt Disney*

<!--
nearly free stuff: books, friends, sleep, stopping bad habits, ideas, gratefulness, experiences, laugh, notice, questions.
-->




---
### On fame and popularity

See fame as a multiplier. If you want to impact the world, be famous.

> *'Do everything in public. Other people are facing the same problems. They will identify with you and provide solutions.'  
'Do things worthy of making you famous. The audience you build allows you to multiply everything you do across all those people. It increases your impact. It makes it easy to sell something. It makes it easy to come up with products and services. They will ask you or you can ask them.' -- Allen Tucker (paraphrased)*

> *'There are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses' -- Bjarne Stroustrup*




---
### On luck

Bad luck is normally bad planning.  
If you're sure it's not, be positive, the pendulum will swing back your way eventually.

> *'«Random» usually means that you haven’t looked long enough to see a pattern emerge.'*

> *'There’s no magic in the world. It’s all math.' -- discrete math professor*

> *'The eternal mystery of the world is its comprehensibility.'*

> *'True good fortune is what you make for yourself. Good fortune: good character, good intentions, good actions.' -- Marcus Aurelius*

> *'God is subtle but he is not malicious.'*

> *'In life, business and relationships we are defined by how we react when things don't go our way.'*

What’s the difference between luck and chance?  
Luck is an open door. Chance is the willingness to step through. This creates the illusion that certain people are luckier.

HOWEVER positive results don't imply good planning..

> *'Even a broken clock is right twice a day.'*

<!--
Bad luck vs. bad planning

Unless you’re winning, life will seem hideously unfair to you. 

> *'Coincidence is God’s way of remaining anonymous.' -- Albert Einstein*

science of patterns.

> *'If you live long enough, most people will get what they deserve.' -- Charlie Munger*

You create your luck by being healthy and not regretting the past or being anxious about the future.

The best things in life are born from coincidence. I am a firm believer in this.

surprises only happen when they didnt repaeat on ones lifetime

> *'Shallow men believe in luck or in circumstance. Strong men believe in cause and effect.' -- Ralph Waldo Emerson*
-->




---
### On beauty

> *'Beauty is not a gift, it's a burden.'*

> *'Once I was beautiful, now I'm myself.'*

> *'A man’s face is his autobiography. A woman’s face is her work of fiction.' -- Oscar Wilde*

> *'Beauty doesn't always correlate with virtue.'*




---
### On health

Health is also an envy trigger. Normally what people really envy is self-control.

HINTS: keeping health

- If you need an alarm clock to get you started mornings, you are cheating yourself on rest.  
- intermittent fasting  
- napping: Take naps at work. Apologize to no one.  
- Balance on body training = flexibility (yoga or animal movements) + strength (weights)  
- Exercise is king. Nutrition is queen. (follow your circadian rhythm, eat more real foods, and exercise more)   
- water, cold, hot, cold shower  
- minimum effective dose  
- Drinking alcohol borrows energy (and happiness) from tomorrow.

> *'Don’t buy complexity; the simpler you make your training, the better the results become.' – Ryan Flaherty*

> *'Memories need sleep to get consolidated. Sleep deprivation is bad for memory. Stress also.'*

> *'If I knew I was going to live this long, I would have taken better care of myself.' -- Mickey Mantle*

> *'There is no such thing as successful aging because aging is damage.' -- Art De Vany*

> *'You weren’t made to spend 10 hours a day staring at a screen in a cubicle arguing over email. If you do this your body will fall apart. As your body falls apart so will your brain. As your brain goes so does your chances of success or happiness.' -- Allen Tucker'*

the specifics are actually highly bio-individual.: What works for one person will not necessarily work for another, because every body is different.
Your body responds to substances, sleep patterns, forms of exercise, and supplementation differently from your best friend’s body which responds differently from his girlfriend’s body.




---
### On lifestyle

'We were designed to [walk dozens of miles each day](#on-travel-and-nomadism), [catch our own meals](?), [live in a close-knit tribe](friends), [have regular sex](relationships), [raise children](mentorship) and die.
When life becomes about [enjoying every second over accumulating more stuff](wealth), we are able to live lives of true abundance and joy.'

'Don't be a plant: [travel](#on-travel-and-nomadism).'

'Run away from complexity. Complexity doesn't add much to life.'

HINTS:

> *'A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.' -- Robert Heinlein*

> *'9 to 5; 3 days a week; 3 weeks a month; 3 months free a year.'*

> *'The opposite of play isn’t work, it’s depression.'*

> *'We don’t stop playing because we grow old; we grow old because we stop playing.'*

> *'Car: max 10K. Job: try to live next to it.' -- paraphrased from Mr. Money Moustache*

> *'Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.' -- Antoine de Saint-Exupéry*

> *'Essencialism: The disciplined pursuit of less.'*

HINT: How to simplify?

- Use simpler tools.  
- Use it or loose it.  
- [Get rid of the unnecessary distractions](focus).  
- [Remove any obligations that aren’t truly serving your end goals](freedom).  
- Your job should be a product of your lifestyle, not the other way around.

*HOWEVER:*

> *'Loneliness really haunts me. That’s a theme for the young – not wanting to be alone, not wanting to be older, not wanting to give up their teenage lack of responsibility. They postpone everything in order to find some beauty, which becomes increasingly difficult as you get older. And you can’t go back to it. It’s an endless subject.' -- John Cassavetes*

<!--
geoarbitrage
	
Work no more than 35 hours a week.

HINTS on the value in less and the joy of missing out:

it’s important to spend a lot of time in nature and with the unique opportunity of discovering yourself. The real work is within. I find that people especially my age, are so distracted with things outside of themselves / needing to prove something.

the unfortunate culture in technology that devalues everything unrelated to militant capitalism. If you’re not trying to make money, what are you even doing?

feel like a local celebrity: everybody knows who you are.
you are in a city, without knowing the language, manage to go to the hostel, meet people there.
make your way there.

Life is a game of tradeoffs. You must eventually choose what you’re willing to trade based on what you value.

Don't play the government’s game. Instead, create a game that worked by my rules, a game I could win.

“the paradise tax”

_meaning_ I quickly realized that I had to find another way to derive meaning from my life than working or productivity. When I’m out in the world, I rent my car on turo and my homes on airbnb. I travel hack to cover the flights. Promote Airbnb for travel credits.

That’s why I wanted to speak to Fred. Not because he wrote “The Soup” episode of Seinfeld. But because he’s still doing what he loves to do. And what he loves to do is constantly changing.

But you're choosing to be uninformed. I'm not choosing ignorance. I'm choosing to not watch wrestling.

My life has been a series of questions and odd experiments.

### On success

There is no shortcut to the top. Success is a castle that you build [brick by brick](#on-habits-and-systems).  
Success is not being [wealthy](#on-wealth) but being [happy](#on-gratefulness-and-happiness).

> *'Success is peace of mind which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you did your best to become the best you are capable of becoming.' -- John Woode*

> *'Success is simple, but it is not easy. Success is nothing but the accumulation of small things done consistently over a long period of time.'*

> *'Success doesn’t come to you. You go to it.' -- Marva Collins*

> *'Try not to become a man of success, rather become a man of value' -- Albert Einstein*

> *'I cannot give you the formula for success, but I can give you the formula for failure, which is: try to please everybody.' -- Herbert Swope*

HOWEVER... [doubt](#on-confidence-and-validation), not failure, is the biggest barrier to success.

> *'The greatest barrier to success is the fear of failure.' -- Sven Goran Eriksson*

> *'Doubt kills more dreams than failure ever will.'*

<!--
Life is About Who You Become Not What You Achieve
On this journey called life, many people lose sight of what is really important.
They believe that material wealth, sexual experiences, and physical prowess are what makes a man.
But the reality is, life is about the man that you become, not the things that you do or the possessions that you gather.
It’s about your character.
It’s about who you impact, the way you show up in the world, and the way that you treat those around you.

Real success happens when we focus on one thing at a time.

There are two things you need to do to be successful.
know what is he right thing and having the courage to do it

rules of success are universal.
“Feel. Don’t think.. Use your instinct.” -- We allow logic and egoic reasoning to dictate what we want (or what we say we want) and what goals we pursue.
But if you want to be truly happy. When you trust your instincts instead of your head, you will be in greater alignment with your true purpose and your actual desires. So drop the logic and just feel.

1. Do What Works and Forget the Rest
But the simple truth is that success leaves clues.
There are certain habits, patterns, and routines that lead to your success, and there are certain patters that will result in failure.

"The successful results of evolution are organisms that aren't perfect, but 'good enough' to survive and reproduce themselves." -- 

> *'You and I know that it isn't what a man has that constitutes wealth. No-it is to be satisfied with what one has-that is wealth.' -- Mark Twain*

Succeeding means securing advantage.

Defining Success for Yourself:
1. What makes me come alive?
2. What do I hate?
3. How Do I Want to Be Remembered?
4. Write Down Your Own Definition of Success

your neeed for aceptance can make you invisible in this world.

> *'A man is a success if he gets up in the morning and gets to bed at night, and in between he does what he wants to do.'*

> *'Success is sequential, not simultaneous.'*

> *'You can often be the biggest barrier to your own success. We aren’t very emotionally open, and often many of us are brought up that way.'*

And when they finally became a “success” they realized that they were no more fulfilled at 40 with $100,000 in the bank and a BMW in the garage than they were flipping burgers at the age of 20 with only $10 to their name. They spent so much time, money, and energy in pursuit of something that didn’t really matter to them. They worked tirelessly to achieve goals that they didn’t truly care about.

success is a dangerous word. i dont know any sucessful person.
sucesses keep you making the same stuff, mistakes not.

> *'To me success has meant just two things: a good life for my family, and the money to buy books and continue the education of this wandering man.' -- Louis L'amour*

> *'It’s never your identity, it’s always your strategy'*

Success is subjective. If you wake up each morning, happy, fulfilled, and full of life, then you are a success.

1. All of Success is About Conquering Yourself
Most people assume that success is all about the mechanics.
Guess what, no matter what you are striving for, you will face failure at some point in your life, however, if you have developed yourself, if you have conquered your own emotions of fear, doubt, and unconfidence, you can return from any failure and be victorious.

1. Success is in Our Decisions Not Our Conclusions
Many people think that success is about the attainment of something, but the truth is, success is about who you become along the way and the decisions that you make.
Success is truly about living a life with honor and integrity, not any material outcome.
success is not the accumulation of stuff

If you want to succeed at anything in your life, then forget about the Joneses.
You don’t need the fancy car, expensive watch, or flashy toys, spend your money on experiences, on your family, and on living a lifestyle that makes you happy. Don’t spend it on getting into a meaningless competition with shallow and materialistic people.

True fulfillment comes from living your life, not from achievement.

Success is Internal not External: If you want to achieve true fulfillment, then realize that happiness is internal.

Experiences worth more than material

“The things we do that get us to feel the true, deep sense of accomplishment are things like running a marathon, climbing a mountain, writing a book, and inventing something,”

The key to all success in life lies in education and massive action.
If you are not constantly expanding your mind, skill sets, and patterns of thought, then you are contracting them.

The story he told me was a combination of luck, learning skills, building a network, and acting on the intersection of all of the above. But more than anything, it’s being open to surrender. Surrendering to constant reinvention.

'You should remember that good ideas are rare. When the odds are greatly in your favor, bet heavily.' -- Charlie Munger*

> *'What an investor needs is the ability to correctly evaluate selected businesses. Note that word “selected”: You don’t have to be an expert on every company, or even many. You only have to be able to evaluate companies within your circle of competence. The size of that circle is not very important; knowing its boundaries, however, is vital.' -- Charlie Munger*

> *'The best companies aren't sold, they're bought.'*

### On travel and nomadism

Travel is the only thing you buy that makes you richer. Traveling as mini lifes.

> *'A good traveler has no fixed plans and is not intent on arriving.' -- Lao Tzu*

> *'Because in the end, you won’t remember the time you spent working in the office or mowing your lawn. Climb that goddamn mountain.' -- Jack Kerouac*

HINTS on travel:

- People who schedule their free time are happier but think less about getting the most for your buck and more about who you’re going with.
And how long should your vacation be? Research says aim for 3 to 6 days. Frequency beats intensity. People have a cultural memory of travelling as expensive but it's not.  
- Travel solves a plethora of self-improvement goals in one fell swoop. Travellers grow in different ways other than careers.  
- How does really traveling differ from a standard vacation? Travelling is getting under the skin of the place.  
- Travellers are the best money managers.

HINTS on nomadism:

> *'Build a business with the heuristic of "Maximize Jason's vacation time":
Stage One: Contracting

# Appendix D - Bonus

### On email

- Keep it under three lines, more than this call.  
- Make the subject unique, meaningful and easily searchable.  
- Use easy-to-read formatting! Font 12/14, bold, underline and ALL CAPS for the MAIN QUESTION, IMPORTANT DATES, and other KEY DETAILS.  
- Put your specific action request in the first line. A busy exec wants to touch an email once and take action: delete, respond or forward for action.
Start with the action/request, and then explain if you need to. be specific in your request: Instead of saying, «Can you meet sometime next week?» say, «Can you meet Wed, Sept 10 in XYZ location between 10 am and 12 pm?»  
- Make a single, specific, simple request – such that it’s hard  to say no.  
The reader should be able to reply to the email in one word (ideally yes or no), or forward it on to the right person.  
Do you have time for a 5 min call this week?  
Please review and sign this document.  
Can you make a quick intro to XYZ person?  
I’d love a letter of support from you. I’ve attached a draft for your review.

### On types of people

hedonists + stoics

takers + matchers + givers

people that like you + people that don't like you + people that don't care about you

finders + grinders (work bees) + minders

<!--
people of all political persuasions

dreamer + maker + manager

introverts have more probability of being an expert in their field
extraversion is not good for mastery
most people are not extremes and most people are in the middle
introvert is not shyness. most things are not binary. Imagine a introvertness scale from 1 to 7.
It's hard to pass from a 2 to 7 but you can pass from 2 to a 3 or 4.

### On superpowers

The ability to [not care what most people think](chapter_2_groups.md#on-criticism-and-envy) is a superpower.

The ability to [change your mind](chapter_3_action.md#on-adapting) is a superpower.

The ability to [listen](chapter_2_groups.md#on-communication) is a superpower.

The ability to [focus](chapter_3_action.md#on-focus-time-management-and-productivity) is a superpower.

<!--
sustainable competitive advantage.Here are five big ones.
1 - The ability to learn faster than your competition
Marc Andreessen promotes the idea of “strong beliefs, weakly held,”

2 - The ability to empathize with customers more than your competition
What percentage of McDonald’s executives frequent their own restaurant as a legitimate customer interested in the chain’s food, rather than a fact-finding mission? Few, I imagine. How many times has the CEO of Delta Airlines been bumped from a flight, or had his bags lost by the airline? Never, I assume.

3 - The ability to communicate more effectively than your competition
Most business edges are found at the intersection of trust and simplicity. Both rely on the ability to tell customers what and why you’re doing something before losing their attention.

4 - The willingness to fail more than your competition
Here’s Bezos again: “If you double the number of experiments you do per year, you’re going to double your inventiveness.”
The key is creating a culture that allows you to fail often without ruin.

5 - The willingness to wait longer than your competition
Expected value refers to the long-run average of a random variable.
