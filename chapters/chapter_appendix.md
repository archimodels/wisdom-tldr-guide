# Appendix A - Time

### On past and memory

You are your memory but *let go* your past [failures](#on-mistakes-and-failure).<br>
They are meant to guide you, not to define you or determine your future.

> *'Half of the game is learning how to forget events in the past that eat away at you and cloud your reason.'*

> *'He'd wasted most of his life thinking he'd wasted most of his life'*

> *'Never regret something that once made you smile.'*

> *'Stop looking for happiness in the same place where you lost it.'*

> *'You can't start the next chapter of your life if you keep re-reading the last one.'*

> *'I don’t know any longer whether I’m living or remembering.' -- Albert Camus*

How memory works? People forget by decaying and giving them other stuff to remember.

> *'People forget future events more than past events.'*

> *'People remember more the beginning and the end of something.'*

> *'Repetition is good for memory but its a thin line between repetition and getting annoyed.'*

You will die soon. Act accordingly and don't postpone joy.

100 blocks a day - wait but why

life is long enough

We are all made of time and we keep wasting each other..

### On future

Dream big. If your dreams don't scare you, they are not big enough.

> *'Anomalies often represent the future but to our eyes they seem strange.'*

# Appendix B - On envy triggers

### On intelligence and talent

Genius and talent are rare, and as such, the most sensitive trigger for envy.

> *'In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts; they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty.' -- Ralph Waldo Emerson*

> *'Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent. It takes a touch of genius, and a lot of courage, to move in the opposite direction.'*

> *'I think we have an ideology about talent that says that talent is a tangible, resilient, hardened, shiny thing. It will always rise to the top. To find and encourage talent, all you have to do as a society, is to make sure the right doors are open. Free campus visits, free tuition, letters to the kids with high score. You raise your hand and say, «over here!» and the talent will come running, but that's not true. It’s not resilient and shiny, talent is really, really fragile.' -- Malcolm Gladwell*

> *'To reveal the true nature of your intelligence rarely pays; you should get in the habit of downplaying it at all times.'*



---
### On wealth

Being rich is not counting money all day but being fulfilled.

> *'Life, is not a having and a getting, but a being and a becoming.' -- Myrna Loy*

> *'Shift your focus from achievement to fulfillment:<br>
What makes you come alive, what do you enjoy doing, who do you enjoy being around?'*

> *'Some people are so poor, all they have is money.'*

> *'It's nice to have a lot of money, but you know, you don't want to keep it around forever. I prefer buying things. Otherwise, it's a little like saving sex for your old age.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'You can spend your time making money but you can't spend your money making time.'*

<!--
“You’re not supposed to optimize for money; you’re supposed to optimize for happiness.”
-- Mr. Money Mustache (AKA Pete Adeney)

---
### On fame

See fame as a multiplier. If you want to impact the world, be famous.

> *'Do everything in public. Other people are facing the same problems. They will identify with you and provide solutions.'<br>
'Do things worthy of making you famous. The audience you build allows you to multiply everything you do across all those people. It increases your impact. It makes it easy to sell something. It makes it easy to come up with products and services. They will ask you or you can ask them.' -- Allen Tucker (paraphrased)*



---
### On luck

Unless you’re winning, life will seem hideously unfair to you.<br>
Be positive, luck is a pattern and the pendulum will swing back your way eventually.

> *'«Random» usually means that you haven’t looked long enough to see a pattern emerge.'*

> *'There’s no magic in the world. It’s all math.' -- discrete math professor*

> *'The eternal mystery of the world is its comprehensibility.'*

> *'True good fortune is what you make for yourself. Good fortune: good character, good intentions, good actions.' -- Marcus Aurelius*

> *'God is subtle but he is not malicious.'*

> *'In life, business and relationships we are defined by how we react when things don't go our way.'*

What’s the difference between luck and chance?<br>
Luck is an open door. Chance is the willingness to step through. This creates the illusion that certain people are luckier.

HOWEVER...

> *'Bad luck is normally bad planning.'*

> *'Even a broken clock is right twice a day.'*

> *'Beauty doesn't always correlate with virtue.'*

> *'Once I was beautiful, now I'm myself.'*

### On lifestyle

'Don't be a plant.'

HINTS:

> *'9 to 5; 3 days a week; 3 weeks a month; 3 months free a year.'*

> *'Essencialism: the value in less and the joy of missing out.'*

> *'Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.' -- Antoine de Saint-Exupéry*

> *'Use it or loose it.'*

> *'Run away from complexity. Complexity doesn't add much to life.'*

> *'Car: max 10K. Job: try to live next to it.' -- Mr. Money Moustache*

> *'Never lose money. Rule No. 2: don’t forget rule No. 1.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'When forced to choose, I will not trade even a night’s sleep for the chance of extra profits.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'The best companies aren't sold, they're bought.'*

> *'Wherever oil goes, the stock market goes.'*

### On science

> *'The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and all science.' -- Albert Einstein*

> *'The whole of science is nothing more than a refinement of everyday thinking.'*

> *'To do science is to search for repeated patterns, not simply to accumulate the facts.' -- Robert MacArthur*

> *'The grand aim of all science is to cover the greatest number of empirical facts by logical deduction from the smallest number of hypotheses or axioms.' -- Albert Einstein*

> *'Science is a wonderful thing if one does not have to earn one's living at it.'*

> *'The most exciting phrase to hear in science is not 'Eureka!' but 'That's funny...' -- Isaac Asimov*

> *'Technological progress is like an ax in the hands of a pathological criminal.'*



---
### On religion

'And on the first day, men created god.'

> *'Science without religion is lame. Religion without science is blind.'*
