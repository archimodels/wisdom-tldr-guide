# Appendix A - Time

### On past and memory

You are your memory but let go your past [failures](#on-mistakes-and-failure).  
They are meant to guide you, not to define you or determine your future. The people who struggle most are the ones who can’t accept the incessant unfairness of life. They become so consumed with what should have happened, the way other people should have behaved that they become incapable of dealing with reality.

> *'Half of the game is learning how to forget events in the past that eat away at you and cloud your reason.'*

> *'He'd wasted most of his life thinking he'd wasted most of his life'*

> *'Never regret something that once made you smile.'*

> *'Stop looking for happiness in the same place where you lost it.'*

> *'You can't start the next chapter of your life if you keep re-reading the last one.'*

> *'Death leaves a heartache no one can heal; love leaves a memory no one can steal.'*

Life becomes very easy when you have studied the past to the extent that you have seen the recurring patterns.

> *'There are years that ask questions and years that answer.' -- Zora Neale Hurston*

> *'We are surrounded by story.' -- Alice McDermott*

> *'History does not repeat, but it does rhyme.' -- Mark Twain*

> *'The historian is not really interested in the unique, but in what is general in the unique.' -- Edward Carr*

> *'There is no past or future. Using tenses to divide time is like making chalk marks on water.'*

How memory works? People forget by decaying and giving them other stuff to remember.

> *'People forget future events more than past events.'*

> *'People remember more the beginning and the end of something.'*

> *'You forget what you want to remember, and you remember what you want to forget.' -- Cormac McCarthy^*

> *'Either I forget right away or I never forget.'*

> *'Repetition is good for memory but its a thin line between repetition and getting annoyed.'*

> *'Memory is never a precise duplicate of the original; instead, it is a continuing act of creation.' -- Rosalind Cartwright*

> *'I don’t know any longer whether I’m living or remembering.' -- Albert Camus*

> *'Collective memory is more about the present than the past because it is integral to how the group sees itself.' -- Margaret MacMillan*

### On present

You will die soon.  
Act accordingly and don't postpone joy: live life ready to meet god like it’s everyone else’s last day. If you can’t find pleasure in the simple or the mundane, you won’t find pleasure anywhere. Just because you are not where you want to be, does not mean that you cannot have fulfillment and joy in the present moment. Learn to reframe your current situation and find meaning within it.

> *'Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.' -- Steve Jobs*

> *'Every day in the mirror I watch death at work.' -- Jean Cocteau*

> *'Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.' -- Mahatma Gandhi*

> *'You’ll miss the best things if you keep your eyes shut.' -- Dr. Seuss*

> *'Never get so busy making a living that you forget to make a life.'*

> *'As you walk and eat and travel be where you are. Otherwise you will miss most of your life.' -- Siddhartha Guatama*

> *'Either write something worth reading or do something worth writing.' -- Benjamin Franklin*

> *'It is never too late to be what you might have been.' -- George Eliot*

> *'What's life? Showing up for the people you love, again and again, until you can’t show up anymore.'* -- Rebecca Walker*

> *'Men are living their whole lives in pursuit of some arbitrary goal that somehow gives them permission to live their lives, love themselves, and enjoy their time on this planet. And frankly, it’s complete bullshit! Life happens in the now. Money is nothing more than a magnifying glass. Money simply makes you more of what you already are. They start by focusing on their goals instead of themselves. They are more than willing to hustle and grind on their business for hours on end, but spending an hour in the gym? Not a chance!'*

<!--
- 100 blocks a day -- wait but why  
- life is long enough
I’m with Seneca. Life doesn’t have to be short. We all have 24h in a day. Every single one of us.
You can use them to create something awesome, to visit that someone special who misses you desperately, to provide for your family, or to savor a great moment. But don’t waste your hours. Don’t end up wondering, “What have I been doing with my time?” Leave a trail of accomplishments or smiles behind you.
- When we listen to the regrets of the elderly and dying, they invariably lament on what they neglected to do, not what they did.
- We are all made of time and we keep wasting each other..
- Time never has, and never will solve a damn thing.

2) Manage emotions to better manage time: it’s your beliefs that create your feelings, not reality.
procrastination is a mood-management technique
3) Important Beats Urgent
You do what’s easy or urgent, not what really moves the needle.
Since the vast majority of our words and actions are unnecessary, corralling them will create an abundance of leisure and tranquility. As a result, we shouldn’t forget at each moment to ask, is this one of the unnecessary things?
Getting a lot of unnecessary things done is not productivity; it’s stupidity.
Doing something well does not make it important. I think this is one of the most common problems with a lot of time-management or productivity advice; they focus on how to do things quickly. The vast majority of things that people do quickly should not be done at all. -- tim ferriss
4) Focus On Effort, Not Outcome
What’s that have to do with productivity? Plenty. Because you worry about all kinds of stuff that you can’t do anything about. And that’s wasted time and energy.
And neuroscience research shows that by focusing on what you have control over, you decrease stress.
You can’t control whether it ends up as a “robbery” or an “attempted robbery”, just focus on executing the heist in a way that would make mom proud.

### On future

Dream big. If your dreams don't scare you, they are not big enough.

> *'Un uomo che vive di ricordi, diventa vecchio. Uno che vive di progetti resta giovane.' -- Bruno Munari*

> *'The greatest risk to a man is not that he aims too high and misses, but that he aims too low and hits.'*

> *'Anyone who lives within their means suffers from a lack of imagination.' -- Oscar Wilde*

> *'If you don't imagine, nothing ever happens at all.' -- John Green*

> *'Life is understood backwards, but must be lived forwards.' -- Kierkegaard*

> *'Anomalies often represent the future but to our eyes they seem strange.'*

> *'Finding a place to die is an important thing to do.' -- Nagasaki*

> *'Rich people think big. Poor people think small.' -- T. Harv Eker*

HOWEVER don't obcess on that.

> *'No matter what you do or make in life, it will be forgotten. And then people will just make it again and pretend that what you did never happened.' -- John Hodgman*

> *'I never worry about the future. It comes soon enough.' -- Albert Einstein*

<!--
- you can't stop the future -> control
- make the exercise: imagine you life in 10years. possible futures.

# Appendix B - On envy triggers

### On intelligence and talent

'In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts; they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty.' -- Ralph Waldo Emerson

'Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent. It takes a touch of genius, and a lot of courage, to move in the opposite direction.' -- Ernst F. Schumacher

Talent is fragile. To reveal the true nature of your intelligence rarely pays; you should get in the habit of downplaying it at all times. It's the most sensitive envy trigger.

> *'Talent hits a target no one else can hit. Genius hits a target no one else can see.' -- Arthur Schopenhauer*

> *'I think we have an ideology about talent that says that talent is a tangible, resilient, hardened, shiny thing. It will always rise to the top. To find and encourage talent, all you have to do as a society, is to make sure the right doors are open. Free campus visits, free tuition, letters to the kids with high score. You raise your hand and say, «over here!» and the talent will come running, but that's not true. It’s not resilient and shiny, talent is really, really fragile.' -- Malcolm Gladwell*

> *'Recipe for genius into one sentence: to have a disinterested obsession with something that matters.' -- Paul Graham*

> *'Andy Warhol is the only genius I’ve ever known with an IQ of 60.' -- Gore Vidal*

> *'Most geniuses prosper not by deconstructing intricate complexities but by exploiting unrecognized simplicities.' -- Andy Benoit*

> *'The true test of intelligence is not how much we know how to do, but how to behave when we don’t know what to do.' -- John Holt*

> *'We like to believe in genius. It gives us an excuse for being lazy.' -- Paul Graham*

<!--
When you don’t create things, you become defined by your tastes rather than ability. Your tastes only narrow & exclude people. So create.
-->

### On money and wealth

Being rich is being fulfilled, not counting money all day.  
Money is a tool. it can serve as a force multiplier to help you live the life of your dreams, enjoy wild adventures and create a lasting legacy.

> *'Life, is not a having and a getting, but a being and a becoming.' -- Myrna Loy*

> *'Shift your focus from achievement to fulfillment: what makes you come alive, what do you enjoy doing, who do you enjoy being around?'*

> *'You can spend your time making money but you can't spend your money making time.'*

> *'You’re not supposed to optimize for money; you’re supposed to optimize for happiness.' -- Mr. Money Mustache*

> *'Some people are so poor, all they have is money.' -- Patrick Meagher*

> *'It's nice to have a lot of money, but you know, you don't want to keep it around forever. I prefer buying things. Otherwise, it's a little like saving sex for your old age.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'Don’t think money does everything or you are going to end up doing everything for money.' -- Voltaire*

> *'We don't make movies to make money; We make money to make more movies.' -- Walt Disney*

> *'After a certain point, money is meaningless. It ceases to be the goal. The game is what counts.' --  Aristotle Onassis*

> *'You spend the first 20 years of being rich accumulating all of this stuff. And then you’ll spend the next 20 years trying to get out of one thing after another to simplify your life.' -- Peter Mallouk*

How to get money (without getting lucky):  
- Seek wealth, not money or status. Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. Money is how we transfer time and wealth. Status is your place in the social hierarchy. Understand that ethical wealth creation is possible. Ignore people playing status games. They gain status by attacking people playing wealth creation games. Money is not the cause of wealth in one’s life. It is the effect. Similarly, when people assume that money is the cause of their problems, they are actually mistaken. Money is usually the most noticeable effect of their problems. Money is a touchy subject. That’s because most of us, to a certain degree, associate a lot of our self-worth and identity to our job and how much money we make. It is, quite literally, a market valuation of our skills and competence as a person.  
- You’re not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity - a piece of a business - to gain your financial freedom.
You will get rich by giving society what it wants but does not yet know how to get. At scale. Pick an industry where you can play long term games with long term people. The Internet has massively broadened the possible space of careers. Most people haven't figured this out yet. Play iterated games. All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest. Money is inherently neutral. It’s merely a vessel for the exchange of experience between two people. You make your money by creating experiences for others.  
- Pick business partners with high intelligence, energy, and, above all, integrity. Don't partner with cynics and pessimists. Their beliefs are self-fulfilling.  
- Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable.  
- Arm yourself with specific knowledge, accountability, and leverage. Specific knowledge is knowledge that you cannot be trained for. If society can train you, it can train someone else, and replace you. Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion rather than whatever is hot right now. Building specific knowledge will feel like play to you but will look like work to others. When specific knowledge is taught, it’s through apprenticeships, not schools. Specific knowledge is often highly technical or creative. It cannot be outsourced or automated.  
- Embrace accountability, and take business risks under your own name. Society will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage. The most accountable people have singular, public, and risky brands: Oprah, Trump, Kanye, Elon.  
- You cannot save your way to wealth.

Nearly free stuff: books, friends, sleep, stopping bad habits, ideas, gratefulness, experiences, laugh, notice, questions.

<!--
> *'You and I know that it isn't what a man has that constitutes wealth. No-it is to be satisfied with what one has-that is wealth.' -- Mark Twain*
-->




---
### On fame and popularity

See fame as a multiplier. If you want to impact the world, be famous.

> *'There are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses' -- Bjarne Stroustrup*




---
### On luck

Bad luck is often bad planning or a closed mind.  
If you're sure it's not, be positive, the pendulum will swing back your way eventually.

> *'«Random» usually means that you haven’t looked long enough to see a pattern emerge.'*

> *'There’s no magic in the world. It’s all math.' -- discrete math professor*

> *'The eternal mystery of the world is its comprehensibility.'*

> *'God is subtle but he is not malicious.'*

> *'Coincidence is God’s way of remaining anonymous.' -- Albert Einstein*

> *'In life, business and relationships we are defined by how we react when things don't go our way.'*

> *'Good fortune: good character, good intentions, good actions.' -- Marcus Aurelius*

> *'If you live long enough, most people will get what they deserve.' -- Charlie Munger*

> *'Shallow men believe in luck or in circumstance. Strong men believe in cause and effect.' -- Ralph Waldo Emerson*

What’s the difference between luck and chance? Luck is an open door. Chance is the willingness to step through. This creates the illusion that certain people are luckier. However positive results don't imply good planning.

> *'Nothing in the world is ever completely wrong. Even a stopped clock is right twice a day.' -- Paulo Coelho*

<!--
> *'I naufraghi prima o poi finiscono per incontrarsi.' -- M. Vázquez Montalban*

- Unless you’re winning, life will seem hideously unfair to you. You create your luck by being healthy and not regretting the past or being anxious about the future. The best things in life are born from coincidence.
- surprises only happen when they didnt repaeat on ones lifetime
- science of patterns.

### On beauty

'If cats looked like frogs we'd realize what nasty, cruel little bastards they are. Style. That's what people remember.' -- Terry Pratchett  

> *'Once I was beautiful, now I'm myself.'*

> *'A man’s face is his autobiography. A woman’s face is her work of fiction.' -- Oscar Wilde*

> *'The sign of a beautiful person is that they always see beauty in others.'* 

> *'Clothes make the man. Naked people have little or no influence on society.' -- Mark Twain*




---
### On health

Health is also an envy trigger. Often what people really envy is self-control.

HINTS: How to keep health?

- Exercise is king. Nutrition is queen. (follow your circadian rhythm, eat more real foods, and exercise more)   
- Balance on body training = flexibility (yoga or animal movements) + strength (weights). Minimum effective dose.  
- Intermittent fasting.  
- If you need an alarm clock to get you started mornings, you are cheating yourself on rest. Take naps at work. Apologize to no one.

> *'Memories need sleep to get consolidated. Sleep deprivation is bad for memory. Stress also.'*

> *'There is no such thing as successful aging because aging is damage.' -- Art De Vany*

> *'You weren’t made to spend 10 hours a day staring at a screen in a cubicle arguing over email. If you do this your body will fall apart. As your body falls apart so will your brain. As your brain goes so does your chances of success or happiness.' -- Allen Tucker'*




---
### On lifestyle

'We were designed to [walk dozens of miles each day](#on-travel-and-nomadism), [catch our own meals](?), [live in a close-knit tribe](friends), [have regular sex](relationships), [raise children](mentorship) and die.
When life becomes about [enjoying every second over accumulating more stuff](#on-money-and-wealth), we are able to live lives of true abundance and joy.'

> *'Don't be a plant: [travel](#on-travel-and-nomadism).'* 

> *'All men die, but not every man lives' -- William Wallace*

HINTS:

> *'A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.' -- Robert Heinlein*

> *'9 to 5; 3 days a week; 3 weeks a month; 3 months free a year.'*

> *'We don’t stop playing because we grow old; we grow old because we stop playing.'*

> *'Because in the end, you won’t remember the time you spent working in the office or mowing your lawn. Climb that goddamn mountain.' -- Jack Kerouac*

> *'The opposite of play isn’t work, it’s depression.'*

> *'I have no plans to retire. It’s the perfect combination of work and play that keep you young.'*

> *'Car: max 10K. Job: try to live next to it.' -- paraphrased from Mr. Money Moustache*

> *'Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.' -- Antoine de Saint-Exupéry*

> *'Essencialism: The disciplined pursuit of less.'*

> *'Own my house on 40 acres with clean water river frontage, and assets i can enjoy & be creative with (car, motorcyles, music equipment, tools etc)'*

> *'I think I’m greedy, but I’m not greedy for money - I think that can be a burden - I’m greedy for an exciting life.' -- David Hockney*

> *'House + work + third place (coffeeshop).'* 

How to reduce your expenses without sacrificing your quality of life?

> *'Spend extravagantly on the things that you love and cut costs mercilessly on the things you don’t.' -- Ramit Sethi*

> *'Geoarbitrage.'*

Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. How to simplify?  
- Use simpler tools.  
- Use it or loose it.  
- [Get rid of the unnecessary distractions](focus).  
- [Remove any obligations that aren’t truly serving your end goals](freedom).  
- Your job should be a product of your lifestyle, not the other way around.
- Lifestyle before money. But money also. Spend your money on experiences and adopt a minimalist lifestyle. Live the life you want now and not later.
- Work no more than 35 hours a week.

However:

> *'Loneliness really haunts me. That’s a theme for the young – not wanting to be alone, not wanting to be older, not wanting to give up their teenage lack of responsibility. They postpone everything in order to find some beauty, which becomes increasingly difficult as you get older. And you can’t go back to it. It’s an endless subject.' -- John Cassavetes*

<!--
- In life, you will often be presented with two options: The lucrative option, The lifestyle option. job -> money + lifestyle!
- value in less and the joy of missing out:
- it’s important to spend a lot of time in nature and with the unique opportunity of discovering yourself. The real work is within. I find that people especially my age, are so distracted with things outside of themselves / needing to prove something.
- the unfortunate culture in technology that devalues everything unrelated to militant capitalism. If you’re not trying to make money, what are you even doing?
- feel like a local celebrity: everybody knows who you are.
You are in a city, without knowing the language, manage to go to the hostel, meet people there. Make your way there.
- Life is a game of tradeoffs. You must eventually choose what you’re willing to trade based on what you value.
- Don't play the government’s game. Instead, create a game that worked by my rules, a game I could win.
- the paradise tax
- find another way to derive meaning from life than working or productivity. When I’m out in the world, I rent my car on turo and my homes on airbnb. I travel hack to cover the flights. Promote Airbnb for travel credits.
- That’s why I wanted to speak to Fred. Not because he wrote “The Soup” episode of Seinfeld. But because he’s still doing what he loves to do. And what he loves to do is constantly changing.
- But you're choosing to be uninformed. I'm not choosing ignorance. I'm choosing to not watch wrestling.
- My life has been a series of questions and odd experiments.
- /r/buyitforlife
- Since he has taken the red pill his hobbies are: working out, writing, mentoring, harem management and self improvement.

### On success

There is no shortcut. Success is a castle that you build [brick by brick](#on-habits-and-systems). But success is not being [wealthy](#on-wealth), is being [happy](#on-gratefulness-and-happiness). Success is subjective. If you wake up each morning, happy, fulfilled, and full of life, then you are a success.

> *'Success is peace of mind which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you did your best to become the best you are capable of becoming.' -- John Woode*

> *'A man is a success if he gets up in the morning and gets to bed at night, and in between he does what he wants to do.'*

> *'Success is simple, but it is not easy. Success is nothing but the accumulation of small things done consistently over a long period of time.'*

> *'Success doesn’t come to you. You go to it.' -- Marva Collins*

> *'Try not to become a man of success, rather become a man of value' -- Albert Einstein*

> *'I cannot give you the formula for success, but I can give you the formula for failure, which is: try to please everybody.' -- Herbert Swope*

> *'Society judges people by what they can do for others. But we judge ourselves by our thoughts.'*

> *'To me success has meant just two things: a good life for my family, and the money to buy books and continue the education of this wandering man.' -- Louis L'amour*

HOWEVER... [fear](#on-confidence-and-validation), not failure, is the biggest barrier to success.

> *'Doubt kills more dreams than failure ever will.'*

> *'Whether you think you can, or you think you can't, you're right.' -- Henry Ford*

And success might have a price.

> *'The pain I feel now is the happiness I had before. That’s the deal.' -- C.S. Lewis*

<!--
- Abilities are not prized by their virtue.
- Real success happens when we focus on one thing at a time.
- There are two things you need to do to be successful: know what is he right thing and having the courage to do it
- rules of success are universal.
- Success is sequential, not simultaneous.
- your neeed for aceptance can make you invisible in this world.
- And when they finally became a “success” they realized that they were no more fulfilled at 40 with $100,000 in the bank and a BMW in the garage than they were flipping burgers at the age of 20 with only $10 to their name. They spent so much time, money, and energy in pursuit of something that didn’t really matter to them. They worked tirelessly to achieve goals that they didn’t truly care about.
- success is a dangerous word. i dont know any sucessful person.
- sucesses keep you making the same stuff, mistakes not.
- It’s never your identity, it’s always your strategy
- Succeeding means securing advantage.

1. Do What Works and Forget the Rest. But the simple truth is that success leaves clues. There are certain habits, patterns, and routines that lead to your success, and there are certain patters that will result in failure.

1. All of Success is About Conquering Yourself
Most people assume that success is all about the mechanics.
Guess what, no matter what you are striving for, you will face failure at some point in your life, however, if you have developed yourself, if you have conquered your own emotions of fear, doubt, and unconfidence, you can return from any failure and be victorious.

1. Success is in Our Decisions Not Our Conclusions
Many people think that success is about the attainment of something, but the truth is, success is about who you become along the way and the decisions that you make.
Success is truly about living a life with honor and integrity, not any material outcome.
success is not the accumulation of stuff

If you want to succeed at anything in your life, then forget about the Joneses.
You don’t need the fancy car, expensive watch, or flashy toys, spend your money on experiences, on your family, and on living a lifestyle that makes you happy. Don’t spend it on getting into a meaningless competition with shallow and materialistic people.

- Success is Internal not External: If you want to achieve true fulfillment, then realize that happiness is internal. True fulfillment comes from living your life, not from achievement. Experiences worth more than material

“The things we do that get us to feel the true, deep sense of accomplishment are things like running a marathon, climbing a mountain, writing a book, and inventing something,”

- The key to all success in life lies in education and massive action. If you are not constantly expanding your mind, skill sets, and patterns of thought, then you are contracting them.

- The story he told me was a combination of luck, learning skills, building a network, and acting on the intersection of all of the above. But more than anything, it’s being open to surrender. Surrendering to constant reinvention.

# Appendix C - Others

### On comedy

Comedy is about observing the hidden truths in life that everyone knows but nobody has ever quite articulated. Standup is about how to articulate that truth in such a way that people feel momentarily unsafe and confused (the setup), and relieved (the punchline).

> *'Anastas, the taste of ice cream interests you more than the construction of communism!' -- Joseph Stalin  to Anastas Mikoyan*

*'Sex, like pizza, when it's good is good. When it's bad it gets in your shirt.'*

> *'There’s a great joke about an automated car plant in Japan, where the machines work in the dark and there are only two living things authorized to be on the factory floor – a man and a dog.  
What’s the man there for? His job is to feed the dog.  
What’s the dog for? The dog keeps the man from touching any of the machines.'*

> *'I miss being the age when I thought I would have my shit together by the time I was the age I am now.'*

Where is home?

> *'Home is where the bra isn´t.'*

> *'Home is where the parking lot is'*

What is love?

> *'What you call love was invented by guys like me to sell nylons.' -- Don Draper*

> *'I really don’t know what «I love you» means. I think it means «don’t leave me here alone».' -- Neil Gaiman*

> *'I am a cage in search for a bird.' -- Franz Kafka*

<!--
- Which is more hipster: using the latest modern web framework, or bragging about how you don't use modern web frameworks?
> *'All God does is watch us and kills us when we get boring. We must never, ever be boring.' -- Chuck Palahniuk*
> *'Eat to please thyself, but dress to please others.' -- Benjamin Franklin*
> *'In Europe 100 miles is a long way, In the US 100 years is a long time'* 
> *'When I'm good, I'm very good, but when I'm bad, I'm better.' -- Mae West*
> *'La que no es puta non desfruta.'*

> *'Já vi o fim do mundo algumas vezes e na manhã seguinte estava tudo bem.'*
> *'The four most expensive words in the English language: «This time is different».'
> *'Reality continues to ruin my life.' -- Bill Watterson*
> *'I remember a humoristic Soviet daily wall calendar that said: «And then we'll destroy the cranes, and the whole world will wonder how we built these pyramids.»'
> *'If you want to keep a secret, you must also hide it from yourself.' -- George Orwell*

To find the truths inside of us that make us all relate to each other. That bring us back to our common humanity. This is why the comedians are the modern day philosophers.

### On humanness and irrationality

> *'If a man gets lost in the mountains, hundreds will search and often two or three searchers are killed. But the next time somebody gets lost, just as many volunteers turn out. Poor arithmetic, but very human. It runs through all our folklore, all human religions, all our literature—a racial conviction that when one human needs rescue, others should not count the price. Weakness? It might be the unique strength that wins us a Galaxy.' -- Starship Troopers by Robert Heinlein*

> *'If there is one thing you can count on, it's human greed. And I'm not pretending I'm above it myself.'*

> *'Most people approach each and every year in the exact same way while (somehow) expecting drastically different results.'*

> *'The problem with people who have no vices is that generally you can be pretty sure they're going to have some pretty annoying virtues.' -- Elizabeth Taylor*

> *'I am lonely, yet not everybody will do. I don't know why, some people fill the gaps and others emphasize my loneliness. In reality those who satisfy me are those who simply allow me to live with my «idea of them».' --  Anaïs Nin*

<!--
- we can define entropy as a measure of the disorder of the universe. Disorder is not a mistake; it's our default. Order is always artificial and temporary.

### On marriage

> *'Marry or do not marry, you will regret it either way. ...Laugh at the stupidities of the world or weep over them, you will regret it either way. ...Trust a girl or do not trust her, you will regret it either way. ...Hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret it either way. ...This, gentlemen, is the quintessence of all the wisdom of life.' -- Kierkegaard, Either/Or*

Hypothetically, if someone were making $100,000 a year and had $100,000 to deploy in some way, how would you suggest they invest that capital?” It was along the lines of, “Invest in the S&P 500 or a low-cost index fund in the S&P 500 and get back to work.”

“When innovative companies begin making decent profits, landlords raise the rents to adjust for the new ability to pay. As a result, these additional wages are neither reinvested, nor reflected in the disposable income of employees. This is the dynamic behind the mystery of stagnant wages. When workers in a particularly well-paid sector begin pouring into a city, landlords likewise raise the rent to absorb these incomes. It isn’t gentrification, but absorption through monopoly power.”

### On travel and nomadism

Travel is the only thing you buy that makes you richer.   
Travel solves a plethora of self-improvement goals. Traveling as mini lifes.

> *'Because in the end, you won’t remember the time you spent working in the office or mowing your lawn. Climb that goddamn mountain.' -- Jack Kerouac*

HINTS on travel:

- Travelling is getting under the skin of the place.  
- For how long? Research says aim for 3 to 6 days of travel. Frequency beats intensity. 
- Think less about money optimization and more about who you’re going with.
- Travellers are the best money managers. People have a cultural memory of travelling as expensive but it's not. Just buy a ticket to the next destination, look for empty seats and get people to take you home.
- Choose places with “lifers”: owners and employees who are dedicated to the business itself, not to a paycheck.

HINT on nomadism:

- Build a business with the heuristic of "Maximize my vacation time":
Contracting -> Travelling Between Contracts -> Travelling While Contracting -> Software Product Business -> Chilling'*

### On books

Reading and experience train your model of the world. And even if you forget the experience or what you read, its effect on your model of the world persists.

> *'The great books are the books that never have to be written again.'-- Carl Van Doren*  
> *'A classic is a book that has never finished saying what it has to say.' -- Italo Calvino*

> *'Every time I read a great book I felt I was reading a kind of map, a treasure map, and the treasure I was being directed to was in actual fact myself.'*

> *'Books say: She did this because. Life says: She did this. Books are where things are explained to you; life is where things aren't. I'm not surprised some people prefer books.' -- Julian Barnes*

> *'I cannot remember the books I have read any more than the meals I have eaten; even so, they have made me.' -- Ralph Waldo Emerson*

<!--
active readers read, the better they get. They develop a latticework of mental models to hang ideas on, further increasing retention. They learn to differentiate good arguments and structures from bad ones.

when writing a book start with your own ideas

> *'Journal Regularly: Cheap paper is less perishable than gray matter. And lead pencil markings endure longer than memory.' -- Jack London*
Paraphrasing the late Chris Cornell, there are no more writers like Shakespeare because all he had was a table, a candle, a pen and some paper.

### On email

- Make the subject unique, meaningful and easily searchable.  
- Make a single, specific, simple request – such that it’s hard to say no - in the first line and then explain if you need to. The reader should be able to reply to the email in one word, forward it on to the right person or delete it so be specific in your request. Examples:
	- «Do you have time for a 5 min call this week?»  
	- «Can you meet Wed, Sept 10 in XYZ location between 10 am and 12 pm?» instead of «Can you meet sometime next week?»
	- «Please review and sign this document.»  
	- «Can you make a quick intro to XYZ person?» 
	- «I’d love a letter of support from you. I’ve attached a draft for your review.»  
- Keep it under three lines, more than this call.  
- Use easy-to-read formatting. Font 12/14, bold, underline and ALL CAPS for the MAIN QUESTION, IMPORTANT DATES, and other KEY DETAILS.

> *'Simplicity is a great virtue but it requires hard work to achieve it and education to appreciate it. And to make matters worse: complexity sells better.' -- Edsger Dijkstra*

> *'I was shocked to realize how dependent I’ve grown on three simple features that just aren’t available in the analog world: search, sort and filter.'*

> *'As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain, as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality.' -- Albert Einstein*

> *'Mathematics is not a careful march down a well-cleared highway, but a journey into a strange wilderness, where the explorers often get lost. Rigor should be a signal to the historian that the maps have been made, and the real explorers have gone elsewhere.' -- William S. Anglin*

> *'If people do not believe that mathematics is simple, it is only because they do not realize how complicated life is.' -- John von Neumann*

In the battle of man vs algorithm, unfortunately, man often loses

All software gets developed under time, budget, management, requirements, and skill constraints that prevent doing anything perfectly. We should keep those constraints and limits in mind when we look at code and immediately conclude the code resists understanding, or that only fools would have produced such software.

- OOP is a natural enemy to concurrency (because of state) and about how transforming data (I.e functional) is a better match
- hash is a fingerprint of an amount of information. SHA256 -> 64 characters
- blockchain is a data structure that individual mistakes doent go unnoticed as they transform in a chain of mistakes
- Anytime machine learning is working quietly in the background, it almost always shows up as a feed in the front-end design
- 90% of webapps are database frontends.
- a fundamental rule of technology: There is no third ecosystem

Top 4 desirable developer skills:
Ability to ignore new tools and technologies;
Taste for simplicity;
Good code deletion skills;
Humility.

AUTOMATION

- This is the classical economic expectation of what would happen as automated output starts to outperform labor, and capital can be automatically produced. When this happens, scarce natural resources (such as location) increase in value. Henry George saw this nearly 140 years ago, with his "Fool's Paradise" thought experiment. As efficiency rises and rises, can the cost of living ever approach zero, or will the landlords (in their many forms) be able to extract what they will?

Until the robots decide to stop feeding their "owners". Money is a social construct. Power comes from controlling energetic resources, and automation is gradually stripping that control away from humans.

In other words, this is the normal destructive (and positive) cycle of capitalism. It is always painful for people who adapt slowly, and provides opportunities for those willing and able to jump into the development and use of new automation tools.

An article somewhere had a useful categorizaiton of automation of jobs in terms of human jobs
1) Automation removes a bottleneck, and lets workers be more productive - often creating more work.
2) Automation removes a better paying job, and leaves behind a less skilled role for humans
But as I have pointed out elsewhere, and economists also admit - retraining is not really an option. For someone to change tack and learn an entirely new set of skills is more than slightly challenging on its own. Let alone with the tensions of losing a job and having to take care of a family with their time needs.
The weakpoint in the larger economic model is retraining.

Humanity stuck on this notion that labor = virtue, which made some sense in an agricultural society where everyone would starve to death if most of the population wasn't actively engaged in production, but is getting increasingly toxic as we approach a post-scarcity world.

The best outcome is the "Culture" endpoint: a post-need society. 10% of people are called upon to work, and the rest thrive on basic income and become artists and inventors, philosophers and musicians and actors.
The worst outcome, on the other hand, is rather more dystopian. A society with a very large percentage of young, unemployed people with no particular path to success is not a stable society.
I suppose it matters how comfortable the 90% is when they become unemployed. Is basic income enough to fulfill individual passions and interests? What happens to a large body of humans whose needs are taken care of but who aren't strictly needed for anything?

Also, do the 10% believe that they are a static group deserving of persistent participation in the "working class" - or is this a competitive and fluid group in which the children of the 90% may move into/out of as their skills/ability apply? Which is to ask - is it worth maintaining a 90% at all or should we 'solve that problem'?

logfromblammo
Prior to industrialization, "pull your own bootstraps" fortunes were extremely rare, and largely a matter of accidentally being in the right place at the right time. Most wealthy folks got there from skimming off their human herd by force or threat of force and by bribing the most docile and cooperative by giving them some of their own production back.
After industrialization, a lot of people were able to leverage first-mover advantages and unrealized frontier opportunities into vast fortunes. But even then, having one extra dollar from daddy in 1790 meant having many, many more to give your own kids by 1820, even if you had 12 of them. That extra dollar might have meant you carried a full feedbag and got there a day before the guy who had to stop to let his horse forage, and getting there first was worth thousands.
Now, daddy's dollars might allow you to start from second place, and grow faster than the first-mover, who might be trying to bootstrap. Or you could do the same with investor money, but with corresponding loss of equity. If mommy or daddy fund you, you probably get to keep more of your own company.

If you go down the history, most wealth was stolen from people violently and from then on anybody born into these aristocratic families would continue benefiting from the wealth.
A lot of new wealth has been created by people born into poor / middle class families in last 1-2 centuries for sure, especially 20th century.
But there are still families today that are wealthy and their wealth have been with them for 400-500 or more years. And in those cases it's very likely the original wealth was stolen.
It could be that original wealth was gathered during robber baron times by exploiting workers or it could be even older, being passed from generation to generation since medieval times. Which means the original aristocracy probably gained this wealth in a violent conquest.

The more likely outcome of a true post-scarcity society is the 90% will be house servants for the 10%.
This has always proved to be unstable.
It will always result in revolution. The 90% will demand an equal share.
The sad bit is that the revolutions seem to destroy the robots, not share the wealth. The 90% elect a different 10%, who then build more robots. See Animal Farm for details.
The 10% have to share the pie, at least enough to prevent revolution.

What will that tech need to survive? Lithium, for batteries. Heavy metals, for processing. Energy, most of all.
I wonder how long it'll be until we replace fiat currencies with a balance of kilowatt-hours.
