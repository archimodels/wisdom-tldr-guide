# Appendix A - Time

### On past and memory

You are your memory but *let go* your past [failures](#on-mistakes-and-failure).  
They are meant to guide you, not to define you or determine your future.

> *'Half of the game is learning how to forget events in the past that eat away at you and cloud your reason.'*

> *'He'd wasted most of his life thinking he'd wasted most of his life'*

> *'Never regret something that once made you smile.'*

> *'Stop looking for happiness in the same place where you lost it.'*

> *'You can't start the next chapter of your life if you keep re-reading the last one.'*

> *'I don’t know any longer whether I’m living or remembering.' -- Albert Camus*

How memory works? People forget by decaying and giving them other stuff to remember.

> *'People forget future events more than past events.'*

> *'People remember more the beginning and the end of something.'*

> *'Repetition is good for memory but its a thin line between repetition and getting annoyed.'* 

<!--
I’m like that. Either I forget right away or I never forget.

> *'Memory is never a precise duplicate of the original; instead, it is a continuing act of creation.'*

The people who struggle most are the ones who can’t accept the incessant unfairness of life. They become so consumed with what should have happened, the way other people should have behaved that they become incapable of dealing with reality.

### On present

You will die soon. Act accordingly and don't postpone joy.

> *'Every day in the mirror I watch death at work.' -- Jean Cocteau*

> *'We are like butterflies who flutter for a day and think it's forever.'*

> *'Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.' -- Mahatma Gandhi*

HINTS:

100 blocks a day -- wait but why

HOWEVER:

> *'Live not in dreams but in contemplation of a reality that is perhaps the future.' -- Rainer Rilke*

<!--
> *'Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.' -- Steve Jobs*

> *'Just because you use your eyes, doesn’t mean you see what’s actually there.' -- Murray Carter*

> *'If you are waiting for anything in order to live and love without holding back, then you suffer.' -- David Deida*

be present

life is long enough

We are all made of time and we keep wasting each other..

But just because you are not where you want to be, does not mean that you cannot have fulfillment and joy in the present moment.
Learn to reframe your current situation and find meaning within it.

the day will always pass, spend your time like money

Time never has, and never will solve a damn thing.

1) Protect Your Time Like Your Money
2) Manage Emotions To Better Manage Time: It’s your beliefs that create your feelings, not reality.
Men are disturbed, not by things, but by the principles and notions which they form concerning things. -- Epictetus
procrastination is a mood-management technique
3) Important Beats Urgent
You do what’s easy or urgent, not what really moves the needle.
Since the vast majority of our words and actions are unnecessary, corralling them will create an abundance of leisure and tranquility. As a result, we shouldn’t forget at each moment to ask, is this one of the unnecessary things?
Getting a lot of unnecessary things done is not productivity; it’s stupidity.
Doing something well does not make it important. I think this is one of the most common problems with a lot of time-management or productivity advice; they focus on how to do things quickly. The vast majority of things that people do quickly should not be done at all. -- tim ferriss
4) Focus On Effort, Not Outcome
What’s that have to do with productivity? Plenty. Because you worry about all kinds of stuff that you can’t do anything about. And that’s wasted time and energy.
And neuroscience research shows that by focusing on what you have control over, you decrease stress.
You can’t control whether it ends up as a “robbery” or an “attempted robbery”, just focus on executing the heist in a way that would make mom proud.
No offense to Karl. He did a survey. So he didn’t necessarily get the right answer, he got the most common answer.

I’m with Seneca. Life doesn’t have to be short. We all have 24h in a day. Every single one of us.
You can use them to create something awesome, to visit that someone special who misses you desperately, to provide for your family, or to savor a great moment. But don’t waste your hours. Don’t end up wondering, “What have I been doing with my time?” Leave a trail of accomplishments or smiles behind you.

When we listen to the regrets of the elderly and dying, they invariably lament on what they neglected to do, not what they did.

### On future

Dream big. If your dreams don't scare you, they are not big enough.

> *'Un uomo che vive di ricordi, diventa vecchio. Uno che vive di progetti resta giovane.' -- Bruno Munari*

> *'Anomalies often represent the future but to our eyes they seem strange.'*

> *'The greatest risk to a man is not that he aims too high and misses, but that he aims too low and hits.'*

> *'Anyone who lives within their means suffers from a lack of imagination.' -- Oscar Wilde*

# Appendix B - On envy triggers

### On intelligence and talent

Genius and talent are rare, and as such, the most sensitive trigger for envy.

> *'In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts; they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty.' -- Ralph Waldo Emerson*

> *'Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent. It takes a touch of genius, and a lot of courage, to move in the opposite direction.'*

> *'I think we have an ideology about talent that says that talent is a tangible, resilient, hardened, shiny thing. It will always rise to the top. To find and encourage talent, all you have to do as a society, is to make sure the right doors are open. Free campus visits, free tuition, letters to the kids with high score. You raise your hand and say, «over here!» and the talent will come running, but that's not true. It’s not resilient and shiny, talent is really, really fragile.' -- Malcolm Gladwell*

> *'To reveal the true nature of your intelligence rarely pays; you should get in the habit of downplaying it at all times.'*



---
### On wealth

Being rich is not counting money all day but being fulfilled.

> *'Life, is not a having and a getting, but a being and a becoming.' -- Myrna Loy*

> *'Shift your focus from achievement to fulfillment:  
What makes you come alive, what do you enjoy doing, who do you enjoy being around?'*

> *'Some people are so poor, all they have is money.'*

> *'It's nice to have a lot of money, but you know, you don't want to keep it around forever. I prefer buying things. Otherwise, it's a little like saving sex for your old age.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'You can spend your time making money but you can't spend your money making time.'*

<!--
“You’re not supposed to optimize for money; you’re supposed to optimize for happiness.” -- Mr. Money Mustache (AKA Pete Adeney)

nearly free stuff: books, friends, sleep, stopping bad habits, ideas, gratefulness, experiences, laugh, notice, question

> *'Don’t think money does everything or you are going to end up doing everything for money.' -- Voltaire*
-->



---
### On fame

See fame as a multiplier. If you want to impact the world, be famous.

> *'Do everything in public. Other people are facing the same problems. They will identify with you and provide solutions.'  
'Do things worthy of making you famous. The audience you build allows you to multiply everything you do across all those people. It increases your impact. It makes it easy to sell something. It makes it easy to come up with products and services. They will ask you or you can ask them.' -- Allen Tucker (paraphrased)*



---
### On luck

Bad luck is normally bad planning.  
If you're sure it's not, be positive, the pendulum will swing back your way eventually.

> *'«Random» usually means that you haven’t looked long enough to see a pattern emerge.'*

> *'There’s no magic in the world. It’s all math.' -- discrete math professor*

> *'The eternal mystery of the world is its comprehensibility.'*

> *'True good fortune is what you make for yourself. Good fortune: good character, good intentions, good actions.' -- Marcus Aurelius*

> *'God is subtle but he is not malicious.'*

> *'In life, business and relationships we are defined by how we react when things don't go our way.'*

What’s the difference between luck and chance?  
Luck is an open door. Chance is the willingness to step through. This creates the illusion that certain people are luckier.

HOWEVER positive results don't imply good planning..

> *'Even a broken clock is right twice a day.'*

<!--
Unless you’re winning, life will seem hideously unfair to you. 

Coincidence is God’s way of remaining anonymous.” – Albert Einstein

science of patterns.

> *'If you live long enough, most people will get what they deserve.' -- Charlie Munger*

You create your luck by being healthy and not regretting the past or being anxious about the future.

The best things in life are born from coincidence. I am a firm believer in this.

surprises only happen when they didnt repaeat on ones lifetime

“Shallow men believe in luck or in circumstance. Strong men believe in cause and effect.” -- Ralph Waldo Emerson

### On beauty

> *'Beauty is not a gift, it's a burden.'*

> *'Once I was beautiful, now I'm myself.'*

> *'A man’s face is his autobiography. A woman’s face is her work of fiction.' -- Oscar Wilde*

> *'Beauty doesn't always correlate with virtue.'*



---
### On lifestyle

'Don't be a plant.'

HINTS:

> *'9 to 5; 3 days a week; 3 weeks a month; 3 months free a year.'*

> *'Essencialism: the value in less and the joy of missing out.'*

> *'Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.' -- Antoine de Saint-Exupéry*

> *'Use it or loose it.'*

> *'Run away from complexity. Complexity doesn't add much to life.'*

> *'Car: max 10K. Job: try to live next to it.' -- paraphrased from Mr. Money Moustache*

HOWEVER:

> *'Loneliness really haunts me. That’s a theme for the young – not wanting to be alone, not wanting to be older, not wanting to give up their teenage lack of responsibility. They postpone everything in order to find some beauty, which becomes increasingly difficult as you get older. And you can’t go back to it. It’s an endless subject.' -- John Cassavetes*

Life is not a checklist.
Life is a game of tradeoffs. And you must eventually choose what you’re willing to trade based on what you value. And if you’re not careful with your values, if you are willing to trade things away for the sake of another hit of dopamine, another temporary trip to your own personal psychological 10,

people have a cultural memory of travelling as expensive.
travelling is getting under the skin of the place
travellers are the best money managers.
travelleres grow in diffrent ways other than careers

I quickly realized that I had to find another way to derive meaning from my life than working or productivity. When I’m out in the world, I rent my car on turo and my homes on airbnb. I travel hack to cover the flights. Promote Airbnb for travel credits.

I think it’s important to spend a lot of time in nature and with the unique opportunity of discovering yourself. The real work is within. I find that people especially my age, are so distracted with things outside of themselves / needing to prove something.

The biggest set back I see around me is limiting beliefs. I see a lot of people telling themselves old stories that keep them stuck in patterns that aren’t serving them. I really enjoy sharing my experiences to show others what is possible. I think the biggest compliment I can ever receive is that I inspired someone, if I’ve done that for even one person, my job is complete. Nothing I’ve done in my career is out of reach to the average person, you’ve just got to believe.

> *'A person often meets his destiny on the road he took to avoid it.' -- Jean de La Fontaine*

tips for great vacations: anticipate, Avoid the 2 big mistakes: Think about your personality and who you’ll be going with. And keep the trip between 3 to 6 dThink a little less about getting the most for your buck and more about who you’re going with and what the two of you will really enjoy. And how long should your vacation be? Research says aim for 3 to 6 days:
People who schedule their free time are happier:

I take a lot of vacation. I find it more enjoyable than working.
So I set out to build a business with the heuristic of "Maximize Jason's Vacation Time".

Stage One: Contracting

Stage Three: Travelling While Contracting

Stage Five: Chillin'

stop viewing our work as our lives

The perpetual chase for more is not the path that leads to more freedom and happiness.
You were not born to only have a successful professional life. You were born to have a great, full, well-balanced happy life.

Men are living their whole lives in pursuit of some arbitrary goal that somehow gives them permission to live their lives, love themselves, and enjoy their time on this planet. And frankly, it’s complete bullshit! Life happens in the now.
Money is nothing more than a magnifying glass. Money simply makes you more of what you already are.
They start by focusing on their goals instead of themselves. They are more than willing to hustle and grind on their business for hours on end, but spending an hour in the gym? Not a chance!

The simple reason for this is that we are not designed to live in this world.
We were designed to walk dozens of miles each day, catch our own meals, live in a close-knit tribe, have regular sex, raise children and die.

### On success

There is no shortcut to the top. Success is a castle that you build [brick by brick](#on-habits-and-systems).  
Success is not being [wealthy](#on-wealth) but being [happy](#on-gratefulness-and-happiness).

> *'Success is peace of mind which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you did your best to become the best you are capable of becoming.' -- John Woode*

> *'Success is simple, but it is not easy. Success is nothing but the accumulation of small things done consistently over a long period of time.'*

> *'Success doesn’t come to you. You go to it.' -- Marva Collins*

> *'Try not to become a man of success, rather become a man of value' -- Albert Einstein*

HOWEVER... [doubt](#on-confidence-and-validation), not failure, is the biggest barrier to success.

> *'The greatest barrier to success is the fear of failure.' -- Sven Goran Eriksson*

> *'Doubt kills more dreams than failure ever will.'*

<!--
There are two things you need to do to be successful.
know what is he right thing and having the courage to do it

rules of success are universal.
“Feel. Don’t think.. Use your instinct.” -- We allow logic and egoic reasoning to dictate what we want (or what we say we want) and what goals we pursue.
But if you want to be truly happy. When you trust your instincts instead of your head, you will be in greater alignment with your true purpose and your actual desires. So drop the logic and just feel.

1. Do What Works and Forget the Rest
But the simple truth is that success leaves clues.
There are certain habits, patterns, and routines that lead to your success, and there are certain patters that will result in failure.

"The successful results of evolution are organisms that aren't perfect, but 'good enough' to survive and reproduce themselves."
Rafe Sagarin

"You and I know that it isn't what a man has that constitutes wealth. No-it is to be satisfied with what one has-that is wealth."
Mark Twain

Defining Success for Yourself:
1. What makes me come alive?
2. What do I hate?
3. How Do I Want to Be Remembered?
4. Write Down Your Own Definition of Success

your neeed for aceptance can make you invisible in this world.

> *'A man is a success if he gets up in the morning and gets to bed at night, and in between he does what he wants to do.'*

> *'Success is sequential, not simultaneous.'*

> *'You can often be the biggest barrier to your own success. We aren’t very emotionally open, and often many of us are brought up that way.'*

And when they finally became a “success” they realized that they were no more fulfilled at 40 with $100,000 in the bank and a BMW in the garage than they were flipping burgers at the age of 20 with only $10 to their name. They spent so much time, money, and energy in pursuit of something that didn’t really matter to them. They worked tirelessly to achieve goals that they didn’t truly care about.

sucess is a dangerous word. i dont know any sucessful person.

sucesses keep you making the same stuff, mistakes not

“To me success has meant just two things: a good life for my family, and the money to buy books and continue the education of this wandering man.”louis-lamour

Succeeding means securing advantage.

> *'It’s never your identity, it’s always your strategy'*

Success is subjective. If you wake up each morning, happy, fulfilled, and full of life, then you are a success.

1. All of Success is About Conquering Yourself
Most people assume that success is all about the mechanics.
Guess what, no matter what you are striving for, you will face failure at some point in your life, however, if you have developed yourself, if you have conquered your own emotions of fear, doubt, and unconfidence, you can return from any failure and be victorious.

1. Success is in Our Decisions Not Our Conclusions
Many people think that success is about the attainment of something, but the truth is, success is about who you become along the way and the decisions that you make.
Success is truly about living a life with honor and integrity, not any material outcome.

success is not the accumulation of stuff

If you want to succeed at anything in your life, then forget about the Joneses.
You don’t need the fancy car, expensive watch, or flashy toys, spend your money on experiences, on your family, and on living a lifestyle that makes you happy. Don’t spend it on getting into a meaningless competition with shallow and materialistic people.

True fulfillment comes from living your life, not from achievement.

Success is Internal not External: If you want to achieve true fulfillment, then realize that happiness is internal.

If you want to succeed at anything in your life, then forget about the Joneses.
You don’t need the fancy car, expensive watch, or flashy toys, spend your money on experiences, on your family, and on living a lifestyle that makes you happy. Don’t spend it on getting into a meaningless competition with shallow and materialistic people

Experiences worth more than material

“The things we do that get us to feel the true, deep sense of accomplishment are things like running a marathon, climbing a mountain, writing a book, and inventing something,”

The key to all success in life lies in education and massive action.
If you are not constantly expanding your mind, skill sets, and patterns of thought, then you are contracting them.

The story he told me was a combination of luck, learning skills, building a network, and acting on the intersection of all of the above. But more than anything, it’s being open to surrender. Surrendering to constant reinvention.

### On assumptions, ideals and beliefs

Beliefs lag behind reality.

But think about some of the things you believed ten years ago… aren’t you embarrassed by some of them? Don’t you wonder how you could’ve ever believed something so ridiculous? Yeah. Exactly. So what are you going to think about the beliefs you have now in ten years?
Knowledge is always moving forward, and it’s probably moving forward a lot faster now than it ever has been. So if we’re going to assume anything, it shouldn’t be that we’re right, but that we’re wrong. Better to be a skeptic than to be delusional.

For example, most of us have a basic understanding of the economics of a restaurant: You rent or buy space, spend money to outfit the place and then hire employees to seat, serve, cook, and clean. (And, if you don’t want to do it yourself, manage.)
From there it’s a matter of generating enough traffic and setting the appropriate prices to generate a profit on the food and drinks you serve—after all of your operating expenses have been paid. Though the cuisine, atmosphere, and price points will vary by restaurant, they all have to follow the same economic formula.

### On email

a) Keep it under three lines, more than this call.

b) Make the subject unique, meaningful and easily searchable.

c) Use easy-to-read formatting! Font 12/14, bold, underline and ALL CAPS for the MAIN QUESTION, IMPORTANT DATES, and other KEY DETAILS.

d) Put your specific action request in the first line. A busy exec wants to touch an email once and take action: delete, respond or forward for action.
Start with the action/request, and then explain if you need to.
be specific in your request: Instead of saying, «Can you meet sometime next week?» say, «Can you meet Wed, Sept 10 in XYZ location between 10 am and 12 pm?»

e) Make a single, specific, simple request – such that it’s hard  to say no.  
The reader should be able to reply to the email in one word (ideally yes or no), or forward it on to the right person.  
Do you have time for a 5 min call this week?  
Please review and sign this document.  
Can you make a quick intro to XYZ person?  
I’d love a letter of support from you. I’ve attached a draft for your review.

### On types of people

hedonists + stoics

takers + matchers + givers

people that like you + people that don't like you + people that don't care about you

finders + grinders (work bees) + minders

<!--
introverts have more probability of being an expert in their field
extraversion is not good for mastery
most people are not extremes and most people are in the middle
introvert is not shyness. most things are not binary. Imagine a introvertness scale from 1 to 7.
It's hard to pass from a 2 to 7 but you can pass from 2 to a 3 or 4.

[Not caring what other people think](chapter_2_groups.md#on-criticism-and-envy) is a superpower.

The ability to [change your mind](chapter_3_action.md#on-adapting) is a superpower.

The ability to [focus](chapter_3_action.md#on-focus-time-management-and-productivity) is a superpower.
