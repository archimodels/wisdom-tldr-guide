# Appendix A - Time

### On past and memory

You are your memory but *let go* your past [failures](#on-mistakes-and-failure).  
They are meant to guide you, not to define you or determine your future.

> *'Half of the game is learning how to forget events in the past that eat away at you and cloud your reason.'*

> *'He'd wasted most of his life thinking he'd wasted most of his life'*

> *'Never regret something that once made you smile.'*

> *'Stop looking for happiness in the same place where you lost it.'*

> *'You can't start the next chapter of your life if you keep re-reading the last one.'*

> *'I don’t know any longer whether I’m living or remembering.' -- Albert Camus*

How memory works? People forget by decaying and giving them other stuff to remember.

> *'People forget future events more than past events.'*

> *'People remember more the beginning and the end of something.'*

> *'Repetition is good for memory but its a thin line between repetition and getting annoyed.'* 

<!--
I’m like that. Either I forget right away or I never forget.

> *'Memory is never a precise duplicate of the original; instead, it is a continuing act of creation.'*

The people who struggle most are the ones who can’t accept the incessant unfairness of life. They become so consumed with what should have happened, the way other people should have behaved that they become incapable of dealing with reality.
-->

### On present

You will die soon. Act accordingly and don't postpone joy.

> *'Every day in the mirror I watch death at work.' -- Jean Cocteau*

> *'We are like butterflies who flutter for a day and think it's forever.'*

> *'Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.' -- Mahatma Gandhi*

> *'Live life ready to meet god.'*

> *'You’ll miss the best things if you keep your eyes shut.' -- Dr. Seuss*

> *'Never get so busy making a living that you forget to make a life.'*

> *'As you walk and eat and travel be where you are. Otherwise you will miss most of your life.' -- Siddhartha Guatama*

HINTS:

100 blocks a day - wait but why

HOWEVER:

> *'Live not in dreams but in contemplation of a reality that is perhaps the future.' -- Rainer Rilke*

<!--
> *'Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.' -- Steve Jobs*

> *'Just because you use your eyes, doesn’t mean you see what’s actually there.' -- Murray Carter*

> *'If you are waiting for anything in order to live and love without holding back, then you suffer.' -- David Deida*

be present

life is long enough

We are all made of time and we keep wasting each other..

### On future

Dream big. If your dreams don't scare you, they are not big enough.

> *'Un uomo che vive di ricordi, diventa vecchio. Uno che vive di progetti resta giovane.' -- Bruno Munari*

> *'Anomalies often represent the future but to our eyes they seem strange.'*

> *'The greatest risk to a man is not that he aims too high and misses, but that he aims too low and hits.'*

> *'Anyone who lives within their means suffers from a lack of imagination.' -- Oscar Wilde*

# Appendix B - On envy triggers

### On intelligence and talent

Genius and talent are rare, and as such, the most sensitive trigger for envy.

> *'In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts; they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty.' -- Ralph Waldo Emerson*

> *'Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent. It takes a touch of genius, and a lot of courage, to move in the opposite direction.'*

> *'I think we have an ideology about talent that says that talent is a tangible, resilient, hardened, shiny thing. It will always rise to the top. To find and encourage talent, all you have to do as a society, is to make sure the right doors are open. Free campus visits, free tuition, letters to the kids with high score. You raise your hand and say, «over here!» and the talent will come running, but that's not true. It’s not resilient and shiny, talent is really, really fragile.' -- Malcolm Gladwell*

> *'To reveal the true nature of your intelligence rarely pays; you should get in the habit of downplaying it at all times.'*



---
### On wealth

Being rich is not counting money all day but being fulfilled.

> *'Life, is not a having and a getting, but a being and a becoming.' -- Myrna Loy*

> *'Shift your focus from achievement to fulfillment:  
What makes you come alive, what do you enjoy doing, who do you enjoy being around?'*

> *'Some people are so poor, all they have is money.'*

> *'It's nice to have a lot of money, but you know, you don't want to keep it around forever. I prefer buying things. Otherwise, it's a little like saving sex for your old age.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'You can spend your time making money but you can't spend your money making time.'*

<!--
“You’re not supposed to optimize for money; you’re supposed to optimize for happiness.” -- Mr. Money Mustache (AKA Pete Adeney)

nearly free stuff: books, friends, sleep, stopping bad habits, ideas, gratefulness, experiences, laugh, notice, question

> *'Don’t think money does everything or you are going to end up doing everything for money.' -- Voltaire*
-->



---
### On fame

See fame as a multiplier. If you want to impact the world, be famous.

> *'Do everything in public. Other people are facing the same problems. They will identify with you and provide solutions.'  
'Do things worthy of making you famous. The audience you build allows you to multiply everything you do across all those people. It increases your impact. It makes it easy to sell something. It makes it easy to come up with products and services. They will ask you or you can ask them.' -- Allen Tucker (paraphrased)*



---
### On luck

Unless you’re winning, life will seem hideously unfair to you.  
Be positive, luck is a pattern and the pendulum will swing back your way eventually.

> *'«Random» usually means that you haven’t looked long enough to see a pattern emerge.'*

> *'There’s no magic in the world. It’s all math.' -- discrete math professor*

> *'The eternal mystery of the world is its comprehensibility.'*

> *'True good fortune is what you make for yourself. Good fortune: good character, good intentions, good actions.' -- Marcus Aurelius*

> *'God is subtle but he is not malicious.'*

> *'In life, business and relationships we are defined by how we react when things don't go our way.'*

What’s the difference between luck and chance?  
Luck is an open door. Chance is the willingness to step through. This creates the illusion that certain people are luckier.

HOWEVER...

> *'Bad luck is normally bad planning.'*

> *'Even a broken clock is right twice a day.'*

<!--
science of patterns.

> *'If you live long enough, most people will get what they deserve.' -- Charlie Munger*

You create your luck by being healthy and not regretting the past or being anxious about the future.

---
### On beauty

> *'Beauty is not a gift, it's a burden.'*

> *'Once I was beautiful, now I'm myself.'*

> *'A man’s face is his autobiography. A woman’s face is her work of fiction.' -- Oscar Wilde*

> *'Beauty doesn't always correlate with virtue.'*



---
### On lifestyle

'Don't be a plant.'

HINTS:

> *'9 to 5; 3 days a week; 3 weeks a month; 3 months free a year.'*

> *'Essencialism: the value in less and the joy of missing out.'*

> *'Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.' -- Antoine de Saint-Exupéry*

> *'Use it or loose it.'*

> *'Run away from complexity. Complexity doesn't add much to life.'*

> *'Car: max 10K. Job: try to live next to it.' -- paraphrased from Mr. Money Moustache*

HOWEVER:

> *'Loneliness really haunts me. That’s a theme for the young – not wanting to be alone, not wanting to be older, not wanting to give up their teenage lack of responsibility. They postpone everything in order to find some beauty, which becomes increasingly difficult as you get older. And you can’t go back to it. It’s an endless subject.' -- John Cassavetes*

Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less

using simpler tools to force simplicity is very interesting

The simple reason for this is that we are not designed to live in this world.
We were designed to walk dozens of miles each day, catch our own meals, live in a close-knit tribe, have regular sex, raise children and die.

(follow your circadian rhythm, eat more real foods, and exercise more)
the specifics are actually highly bio-individual.
What works for one person will not necessarily work for another, because every body is different.
Your body responds to substances, sleep patterns, forms of exercise, and supplementation differently from your best friend’s body which responds differently from his girlfriend’s body.

How does really traveling differ from a standard vacation?

When life becomes about seizing every moment enjoying every second over accumulating more stuff, we are able to live lives of true abundance and joy.

Simplify. Cut the crap. Get rid of the unnecessary distractions. Toss out any possessions that don’t bring value or joy into your life. Remove any obligations that aren’t truly serving your end goals.

> *'It is often said that the secret to getting rich is not to make more money, but to keep it.'*

> *'Do not save what is left after spending, but spend what is left after saving.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'Never lose money. Rule No. 2: don’t forget rule No. 1.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'When forced to choose, I will not trade even a night’s sleep for the chance of extra profits.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'Wherever oil goes, the stock market goes.'*

HINT: How to spot good investments?

> *'The best companies aren't sold, they're bought.'*

> *'What an investor needs is the ability to correctly evaluate selected businesses. Note that word “selected”: You don’t have to be an expert on every company, or even many. You only have to be able to evaluate companies within your circle of competence. The size of that circle is not very important; knowing its boundaries, however, is vital.' -- Charlie Munger*

> *'You should remember that good ideas are rare - when the odds are greatly in your favor, bet heavily.' -- Charlie Munger*

> *'What's your religion? Arbitrage and rents.' -- EF*

HINT: How to buy low and sell high?

> *'Don’t buy on future hopes; only buy on past mistakes.'*

> *'Sit on your ass. You’re paying less to brokers, you’re listening to less nonsense, and if it works, the tax system gives you an extra one, two, or three percentage points per annum.' -- Charlie Munger*

Everything is economy. -- EF

deleveraging = reducing balance sheet from both sides

For example, most of us have a basic understanding of the economics of a restaurant: You rent or buy space, spend money to outfit the place and then hire employees to seat, serve, cook, and clean. (And, if you don’t want to do it yourself, manage.)
From there it’s a matter of generating enough traffic and setting the appropriate prices to generate a profit on the food and drinks you serve—after all of your operating expenses have been paid. Though the cuisine, atmosphere, and price points will vary by restaurant, they all have to follow the same economic formula.

charlie munger:'.If you want to improve your odds of success in life and business then define the perimeter of your circle of competence, and operate inside. Over time, work to expand that circle but never fool yourself about where it stands today, and never be afraid to say “I don’t know.''
