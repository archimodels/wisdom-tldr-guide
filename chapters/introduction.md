### The real you

> *'Waking up to who you are requires letting go of who you imagine yourself to be.' -- Alan Watts*

You are your deeds: your actions reveal your real values.  
How you do anything is how you do everything. Ultimately you are your choices.

> *'Weakness of attitude becomes weakness of character.' -- Albert Einstein*
  
HINT: to come alive. A man is and should be an evolving target. Never stop working on yourself.  
Always strive to be better. Is succeeding at mediocrity a worthwhile life?
For some of you, you must make the conscious decision that you are going to change your story.
No matter where you are in your life, you have the power to change everything in an instant.

You need to develop an unshakable identity as a high achiever and peak performer before you can expect to achieve highly or perform at your peak.

> *'Don’t ask yourself what the world needs, ask yourself what makes you come alive and go do that. Because what the world needs is more people to come alive.' -- Howard Thurman*

> *'There comes a time when you ought to start doing what you want. Take a job that you love. You will jump out of bed in the morning. I think you are out of your mind if you keep taking jobs that you don't like because you think it will look good on your resume.' -- Warren Buffett*

Life is not something that “has' meaning -- it’s something we give meaning to. You don’t “end up' with a meaningful life, you create it.

There have been times where I felt conflicted and confused, where I mourned for a past self that I knew I would never see again while anxiously awaiting a future self who seemingly would never come. Old habits, both good and bad, have fallen by the wayside while I’ve picked up both good and bad habits to fill their space. mm

There are many yous: Like apps on a smartphone, different systems in your brain with different goals can take control at different times, which is why you can behave so inconsistently.
Feelings are what give a module control: You get worked up by what your buddy said and suddenly your brain is hijacked by “Angry Birds” instead of “Words With Friends.”
Meditation can prevent hijacking: Over time, meditation can rewire your brain to be less impulsively reactive and allow you to thoughtfully respond to your feelings.
Mini-meditations help in the moment: By focusing on your breath during a tense moment you can get some of the long term effects of meditation right when you need them.

### On happiness

'Happiness = reality / expectations'  
Seek happiness actively (action) and passively (lower expectations). Derived from:

> *'Need to jump start happiness? Lower your expectations.'  
'If I have no expectations than I will easily exceed them' -- James Altucher*

What's happiness? Happiness is...

> *'...not a goal, it's a byproduct.' -- Eleanor Roosevelt*  
*'...a journey, not a destination.' -- Ben Sweetland*  
*'...inside you, not with another person.'*  
*'...your default state when you remove everything.' -- Naval Ravikant*

'Happy life = mastery + belonging + autonomy'

HINT: How to improve reality? Act, be patient and break long term goals into smaller ones so you can enjoy the journey.

> *'A pessimist sees a difficulty in every opportunity. An optimist sees an opportunity in every difficulty.'*

> *'While optimists will sometimes mistake a steaming turd for pure gold, they will not miss a piece of genuine gold when it crosses their path.'*

> *'We have the idea that comfort brings happiness. Happiness comes from not having fear.'*

> *'We derive our true sense of fulfillment from constantly pursuing a life of «uncomfortability».'*

> *'The minute you're satisfied with where you are, you aren't there anymore.' -- Tony Gwynn*

> *'One of the keys to happiness is a bad memory.' -- Rita Mae Brown*

HINT: How to lower your expectations? Be [grateful]().

<!--
> *'And all the books you've read have been read by other people. And all the songs you've loved have been heard by other people. And that girl that's pretty to you is pretty to other people. and that if you looked at these facts when you were happy, you would feel great because you are describing 'unity.' -- Stephen Chbosky*
	
> *'Many people lose the small joys in the hope for the big happiness.' -- Pearl S. Buck*

regrets of the dying: Don't ignore your dreams; don't work too much; say what you think; cultivate friendships; be happy.

True happiness, at its core, is simply about creating a life where your positive experiences and emotions outweigh the bad ones.
You need to understand that you aren’t supposed to be happy all the time.
You need the negative emotions and difficult times to help you appreciate it when things are great.
Happiness isn’t something that you achieve. It’s not a goal to be had.
It’s a state that you have access to every second of every day. Happiness is a choice.

psychological bias that’s very common but can be disastrous to poker players (and the rest of us as well). It’s called “resulting,” and it’s when you judge the quality of a decision by its outcome.It’s a narrative fallacy: a decision can be good but still garner a bad result, because other circumstances, like luck, are in play.

Encourage people to think in terms of probabilities
you cant guarantee good outcome, you can is maximise the chances

love, sucess and happiness are a byproduct

It’s quite liberating to understand reality as a construction.

happiness is not about positive thoughts. but every positive thought is based on a negative thought.
happiness is about absense of desire! and embrace the presence on the present time.

You Don’t Have to Pick Happiness or Profit
If you are unhappy, use your pain to fuel you towards the pleasure of something new.

> *'Anchor yourself -- remember who you are, the things you are good at, even when completely different thing. authentic self is a state'*

high expectations make you miserable, expectations nowadays are more and more triggered by top of hierarchy being more exposed

> *'Life is not a problem to be solved but a reality to be experienced.' -- Soren Kierkegaard*

being good being a man is being good in survival: honour, strenght, mastery, courage

I’m a straight capitalist-meritocratist, entirely driven by gratitude.

people are in the excuse business

> *'Success is getting what you want. Happiness is wanting what you get.' -- Dale Carnegie*

> *'Happiness is not in the mere possession of money; it lies in the joy of achievement, in the thrill of creative effort.' -- Franklin D. Roosevelt

> *'You can’t lose everything when what you care about are the people and the memories you have.' -- Blake Mycoskie*

Self-worth is how you feel about the negative aspects of yourself.
The people who truly have self-worth are humble. They don’t think they’re something special. They know what they are and what they aren’t, and they’re okay with it.

9. Entitlement comes in two forms.
Form one: I’m better than everybody and therefore deserve special treatment.
Form two: I’m worse than everybody and therefore deserve special treatment.
They’re both forms of narcissism (because they’re both about me me me), and both are pretty much never true. Which one do you usually fall into?

Why we should always question our assumptions -- “what if I’m wrong about this?”
How to define success for yourself. self-awareness?

> *'The more something threatens your identity, the more you will avoid it.' -- Manson’s Law of Avoidance*

> *'Tolerance of intolerance is cowardice.' -- Ayaan Hirsi Ali*

> *'Evil will prevail if good men stand back and do nothing.'*

> *'I myself am made entirely of flaws, stitched together with good intentions.' -- Augusten Burroughs*

> *'Ego is the unhealthy belief in our own importance.'*

> *'When I let go of what I am, I become what I might be. When I let go of what I have, I receive what I need.'*

Happiness is a choice, and if you aren’t choosing to be happy along the journey, you will arrive at the destination and wonder “Is this it?”

Happiness Comes from Autonomy Not Money

Persistence + Love = Abundance

Focus on Internal Fulfillment Not External Success

In the absence of such an outlet, masculine energy collapses. Men lose their sense of drive, purpose, and self-respect, and their standards, hardihood, and discipline atrophy. A slide into restlessness, vice, malaise, and outright depression is often the result.

> *'What the superior man seeks is in himself; what the small man seeks is in others.' -- Confucius*

be happy -> people less sucessful
be sucessful -> people more sucessful
