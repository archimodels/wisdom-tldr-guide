## The real you

> *'Waking up to who you are requires letting go of who you imagine yourself to be.' -- Alan Watts*

You are your deeds. Your actions reveal your real values.  
How you do anything is how you do everything. Ultimately you are your choices.

> *'All men die, but not every man lives' -- William Wallace*

> *'Weakness of attitude becomes weakness of character.' -- Albert Einstein*
  
### How to come alive?

> *'Don’t ask yourself what the world needs, ask yourself what makes you come alive and go do that. Because what the world needs is more people to come alive.' -- Howard Thurman*

Never stop working on yourself. Always strive to be better. Is succeeding at mediocrity a worthwhile life? For some of you, you must make the conscious decision that you are going to change your story. No matter where you are in your life, you have the power to change everything in an instant. You need to develop an unshakable identity as a high achiever and peak performer before you can expect to achieve highly or perform at your peak.

> *'There comes a time when you ought to start doing what you want. Take a job that you love. You will jump out of bed in the morning. I think you are out of your mind if you keep taking jobs that you don't like because you think it will look good on your resume.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'Whatever you are, be a good one.' -- Abraham Lincoln*

> *'Maybe who we are isn't so much about what we do, but rather what we're capable of when we least expect it' -- Jodi Picoult*

> *'Your temporary circumstances do not have to become your permanent identity' -- Greg Hartle*

<!--
> *'Tomorrow, you promise yourself, will be different, yet, tomorrow is too often a repetition of today.' -- James T. McKay*
There is no coming to consciousness without pain. People will do anything, no matter how absurd, in order to avoid facing their own soul.
to be real you need to be vulnerable
> *'Do you want to know who you are? Don't ask. Act! Action will delineate and define you.' -- Thomas Jefferson*

## On happiness

> *'Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony.' --  Mahatma Gandhi*

> *'Need to jump start happiness? Lower your expectations. If I have no expectations then I will easily exceed them' -- James Altucher*

What is happiness?

- Happiness = reality / expectations  
- Happy life = mastery + belonging + autonomy

> *'Happiness is not a goal, it's a byproduct.' -- Eleanor Roosevelt*

> *'Happiness is a journey, not a destination.' -- Ben Sweetland*

> *'Success is getting what you want. Happiness is wanting what you get.' -- Dale Carnegie*

> *'Happiness in intelligent people is the rarest thing I know.' -- Ernest Hemingway*

> *'Happiness is your default state when you remove everything.' -- Naval Ravikant*

Seek happiness actively (improve reality) and passively (lower expectations).

### How to improve reality?

Act, be patient and break long term goals into smaller ones so you can enjoy the journey.  
We derive our true sense of fulfillment from constantly pursuing a life of «uncomfortability».

> *'We have the idea that comfort brings happiness. Happiness comes from not having fear.'*

> *'Action may not always bring happiness, but there is no happiness without action.' -- Benjamin Disraeli*

### How to lower expectations?

Be [grateful](chapter_1_self.md#on-gratitude).

> *'Many people lose the small joys in the hope for the big happiness.' -- Pearl S. Buck*

> *'One of the keys to happiness is a bad memory.' -- Rita Mae Brown*

> *'I think and think and think, I‘ve thought myself out of happiness one million times, but never once into it.' -- Jonathan Safran Foer*

<!--
> *'The rise is always better than the peak.' -- Jim Jefferies*
> *'The minute you're satisfied with where you are, you aren't there anymore.' -- Tony Gwynn*
> *'What the superior man seeks is in himself; what the small man seeks is in others.' -- Confucius*

- It's a mountain of a dream and a mile-high climb to the top. And what it took me a long time to discover is that I didn't like ot climb much. I just liked to imagine the summit.
- It’s quite liberating to understand reality as a construction.  
- High expectations make you miserable, expectations nowadays are more and more triggered by top of hierarchy being more exposed.
- Anchor yourself -- remember who you are, the things you are good at, even when completely different thing. authentic self is a state
- Encourage people to think in terms of probabilities. You cant guarantee good outcome, you can is maximise the chances
- Focus on internal fulfillment not external success
- Happiness is outside of my comfort zone.
- Happiness comes from autonomy not money.
- Love, sucess and happiness are a byproduct
- Persistence + Love = Abundance
- Regrets of the dying: Don't ignore your dreams; don't work too much; say what you think; cultivate friendships; be happy.
- In the absence of such an outlet, masculine energy collapses. Men lose their sense of drive, purpose, and self-respect, and their standards, hardihood, and discipline atrophy. A slide into restlessness, vice, malaise, and outright depression is often the result.
- I’m a straight capitalist-meritocratist, entirely driven by gratitude.
- If you aren’t happy on the journey you won’t be happy at the destination.
- If you cannot learn to be happy while you are building your business, you will not be happy when you sell it for $10 million.
