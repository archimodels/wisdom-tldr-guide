> *'Waking up to who you are requires letting go of who you imagine yourself to be.' -- Alan Watts*

'If I have no expectations than I will easily exceed them' -- James Altucher*

> *'Happiness is not a goal, it is a byproduct.' -- Eleanor Roosevelt*

> *'Happiness is a journey, not a destination.' -- Ben Sweetland*

> *'Happy life = mastery + belonging + autonomy.'*

HINT: How to improve reality? Act, be patient and break long term goals into smaller ones so you can enjoy the journey.

> *'A pessimist sees a difficulty in every opportunity. An optimist sees an opportunity in every difficulty.'*

> *'While optimists will sometimes mistake a steaming turd for pure gold, they will not miss a piece of genuine gold when it crosses their path.'*

> *'We have the idea that comfort brings happiness. Happiness comes from not having fear.'*

> *'We derive our true sense of fulfillment from constantly pursuing a life of «uncomfortability».'*

> *'The minute you're satisfied with where you are, you aren't there anymore.' -- Tony Gwynn*

HINT: How to lower your expectations? Be [grateful]().

Self-worth is how you feel about the negative aspects of yourself.
The people who truly have self-worth are humble. They don’t think they’re something special. They know what they are and what they aren’t, and they’re okay with it.

9. Entitlement comes in two forms.
Form one: I’m better than everybody and therefore deserve special treatment.
Form two: I’m worse than everybody and therefore deserve special treatment.
They’re both forms of narcissism (because they’re both about me me me), and both are pretty much never true. Which one do you usually fall into?

Why we should always question our assumptions -- “what if I’m wrong about this?”

Happiness is a choice, and if you aren’t choosing to be happy along the journey, you will arrive at the destination and wonder “Is this it?”

Happiness Comes from Autonomy Not Money

Persistence + Love = Abundance

Focus on Internal Fulfillment Not External Success

In the absence of such an outlet, masculine energy collapses. Men lose their sense of drive, purpose, and self-respect, and their standards, hardihood, and discipline atrophy. A slide into restlessness, vice, malaise, and outright depression is often the result.

> *'What the superior man seeks is in himself; what the small man seeks is in others.' -- Confucius*
