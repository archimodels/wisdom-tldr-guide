### On happiness

*'Need to jump start happiness? Lower your expectations. If I have no expectations than I will easily exceed them' -- James Altucher*

Happiness = reality / expectations    
Seek happiness actively (action) and passively (lower expectations).  
It’s quite liberating to understand reality as a construction.  
High expectations make you miserable, expectations nowadays are more and more triggered by top of hierarchy being more exposed

What's happiness?

> *'Happiness is not a goal, it's a byproduct.' -- Eleanor Roosevelt*

> *'Happiness is a journey, not a destination.' -- Ben Sweetland*

> *'Happiness is inside you, not with another person.'*

> *'Happiness is your default state when you remove everything.' -- Naval Ravikant*

How to improve reality? Act, be patient and break long term goals into smaller ones so you can enjoy the journey.

> *'A pessimist sees a difficulty in every opportunity. An optimist sees an opportunity in every difficulty.'*

> *'While optimists will sometimes mistake a steaming turd for pure gold, they will not miss a piece of genuine gold when it crosses their path.'*

> *'We have the idea that comfort brings happiness. Happiness comes from not having fear.'*

> *'We derive our true sense of fulfillment from constantly pursuing a life of «uncomfortability».'*

> *'The minute you're satisfied with where you are, you aren't there anymore.' -- Tony Gwynn*

> *'One of the keys to happiness is a bad memory.' -- Rita Mae Brown*

> *'Success is getting what you want. Happiness is wanting what you get.' -- Dale Carnegie*

> *'I think and think and think, I‘ve thought myself out of happiness one million times, but never once into it.' -- Jonathan Safran Foer*

How to lower your expectations? Be [grateful]().

'Happy life = mastery + belonging + autonomy'

> *'Many people lose the small joys in the hope for the big happiness.' -- Pearl S. Buck*

<!--
- Anchor yourself -- remember who you are, the things you are good at, even when completely different thing. authentic self is a state
- Encourage people to think in terms of probabilities. You cant guarantee good outcome, you can is maximise the chances
- Focus on internal fulfillment not external success
- Happiness and well-being are also outside of the comfort zone. You have to travel into your discomfort to find the silver linings hidden. The mystery. Happiness is outside of my comfort zone. Every day. temos q estar sempre nos limites para sermos felizes.
- Happiness comes from autonomy not money
- Happiness is a choice, and if you aren’t choosing to be happy along the journey, you will arrive at the destination and wonder “Is this it?”
- Happiness is not about positive thoughts but every positive thought is based on a negative thought. Happiness is about absense of desire! and embrace the presence on the present time.	
- Love, sucess and happiness are a byproduct
- Persistence + Love = Abundance
- Regrets of the dying: Don't ignore your dreams; don't work too much; say what you think; cultivate friendships; be happy.
- True happiness, at its core, is simply about creating a life where your positive experiences and emotions outweigh the bad ones.
You need to understand that you aren’t supposed to be happy all the time. You need the negative emotions and difficult times to help you appreciate it when things are great. Happiness isn’t something that you achieve. It’s not a goal to be had. It’s a state that you have access to every second of every day. Happiness is a choice.
- In the absence of such an outlet, masculine energy collapses. Men lose their sense of drive, purpose, and self-respect, and their standards, hardihood, and discipline atrophy. A slide into restlessness, vice, malaise, and outright depression is often the result.
- I’m a straight capitalist-meritocratist, entirely driven by gratitude.
